      "Anne Frank kept a diary from June 12, 1942, to August 1, 1944. I nitially, she wrote \n",
      "it strictly for herself. Then, one day in 1944, Gerrit Bolkes tein, a member of the \n",
      "Dutch government in exile, announced in a radio broadcast fr om London that after the \n",
      "war he hoped to collect eyewitness accounts of the suffering of the Dutch people \n",
      "under the German occupation, which could be made available t o the public. As an \n",
      "example, he specifically mentioned letters and diaries. \n",
      "Impressed by this speech, Anne Frank decided that when the wa r was over she would \n",
      "publish a book based on her diary. She began rewriting and edi ting her diary, \n",
      "improving on the text, omitting passages she didn't think we re interesting enough and \n",
      "adding others from memory. At the same time, she kept up her or iginal diary. In the \n",
      "scholarly work The Diary of Anne Frank: The Critical Edition (1989), Anne's first, \n",
      "unedited diary is referred to as version a, to distinguish it from her second, edited \n",

      "The last entry in Anne's diary is dated August 1, 1944. On Augu st 4, 1944, the eight \n",

      "secretaries working in the building, found Anne's diaries s trewn allover the floor. ,Miep \n",
      "Gies tucked them away in a desk drawer for safekeeping. After the war, when it \n",
      "became clear that Anne was dead, she gave the diaries, unread , to Anne's father, Otto \n",
      "Frank. \n",
      "After long deliberation, Otto Frank decided to fulfill his d aughter's wish and publish \n",
      "her diary. He selected material from versions a and b, editin g them into a shorter \n",
      "version later referred to as version c. Readers all over the w orld know this as The \n",
      "Diary of a fauna Girl. \n",
      "In making his choice, Otto Frank had to bear several points in mind. To begin with, the book had to be kept short so that it would fit in with a serie s put out by the \n",
      "Dutch publisher. In addition, several passages dealing wit h Anne's sexuality were \n",
      "omitted; at the time of the diary's initial publication, in 1 947, it was not customary to \n",
      "write openly about sex, and certainly not in books for young a dults. Out of respect for \n",
      "the dead, Otto Frank also omitted a number of unflattering pa ssages about his wife and \n",
      "the other residents of the Secret Annex. Anne Frank, who was t hirteen when she \n",
      "began her diary and fifteen when she was forced to stop, wrote without reserve about \n",

      "Margot and I started packing our most important belongings i nto a schoolbag. The first \n",

      "going off to spend the night in a refrigerator, and all that ju st so we could take more \n",
      "clothes with us. No Jew in our situation would dare leave the h ouse with a suitcase \n",

      "a schoolbag and a shopping bag filled to the brim with the most varied assortment of \n",
      "items. The people on their way to work at that early hour gave u s sympathetic looks; \n",
      "you could tell by their faces that they were sorry they couldn 't offer us some kind of \n",
      "transportation; the conspicuous yellow star spoke for itse lf. \n",
      "Only when we were walking down the street did Father and Mothe r reveal, little by \n",

      "father, works in the warehouse, along with two assistants, n one of whom were told \n",
      "anything. \n",
      "Here's a description of the building. The large warehouse on the ground floor is used \n",
      "as a workroom and storeroom and is divided into several diffe rent sections, such as \n",
      "the stockroom and the milling room, where cinnamon, cloves a nd a pepper substitute \n",
      "are ground. \n",
      "Next to the warehouse doors is another outside' door, a separ ate entrance to the \n",

      "written in black letters. This is the big front office -- very large, very light and \n",
      "very full. Bep, Miep and Mr. Kleiman work there during the day . After passing through \n",
      "an alcove containing a safe, a wardrobe and a big supply cupbo ard, you come to the \n",
      "small, dark, stuffy back office. This used to be shared by Mr. Kugler and Mr. van \n",
      "Daan, but now Mr. Kugler is its only occupant. Mr. Kugler's of fice can also be reached \n",
      "from the hallway, but only through a glass door that can be ope ned from the inside \n",
      "but not easily from the outside. If you leave Mr. Kugler's off ice and proceed through \n",

      "the private office, the showpiece of the entire building. El egant mahogany furniture, a \n",

      "WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1942 \n",
      "Dearest Kitty, \n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. van Daan have had a terrible fight. I've never see n anything like it, since \n",
      "Mother and Father wouldn't dream of shouting at each other li ke that. The argument \n",
      "was based on something so trivial it didn't seem worth wastin g a single word on it. \n",
      "Oh well, to each his own. \n",
      "Of course, it's very difficult for Peter, who gets caught in t he middle, but no one \n",
      "takes Peter seriously anymore, since he's hypersensitive a nd lazy. Yesterday he was \n",
      "beside himself with worry because his tongue was blue instea d of pink. This rare \n",
      "phenomenon disappeared as quickly as it came. Today he's wal king around with a \n",
      "heavy scarf on because he's got a stiff neck. His Highness has been complaining of \n",
      "lumbago too. Aches and pains in his heart, kidneys and lungs a re also par for the \n",
      "course. He's an absolute hypochondriac! (That's the right w ord, isn't it?) \n",
      "Mother and Mrs. van Daan aren't getting along very well. Ther e are enough reasons \n",
      "for the friction. To give you one small example, Mrs. van D. ha s removed all but \n",
      "three of her sheets from our communal linen closet. She's ass uming that Mother's can \n",
      "be used for both families. She'll be in for a nasty surprise wh en she discovers that \n",
      "Mother has followed her lead. \n",
      "Furthermore, Mrs. van D. is ticked off because we're using he r china instead of ours. \n",
      "She's still trying to find out what we've done with our plates ; they're a lot closer than \n",
      "she thinks, since they're packed in cardboard boxes in the at tic, behind a load of \n",
      "Opekta advertising material. As long as we're in hiding, the plates will remain out of \n",
      "her reach. Since I'm always having accidents, it's just as we ll! Yesterday I broke one \n",
      "of Mrs. van D.'s soup bowls. \n",
      "\"Oh!\" she angrily exclaimed. \"Can't you be more careful? Tha t was my last one.\" \n",
      "Please bear in mind, Kitty, that the two ladies speak abomina ble Dutch (I don't dare \n",
      "comment on the gentlemen: they'd be highly insulted). If you were to hear their \n",
      "bungled attempts, you'd laugh your head off. We've given up p ointing out their errors, \n",
      "since correcting them doesn't help anyway. Whenever I quote Mother or Mrs. van \n",
      "Daan, I'll write proper Dutch instead of trying to duplicate their speech. Last week there was a brief interruption in our monotonous ro utine. This was provided \n",
      "by Peter -- and a book about women. I should explain that Margo t and Peter are \n",
      "allowed to read nearly all the books Mr. Kleiman lends us. But the adults preferred to \n",
      "keep this special book to themselves. This immediately piqu ed Peter's curiosity. What \n",
      "forbidden fruit did it contain? He snuck off with it when his m other was downstairs \n",
      "talking, and took himself and his booty to the loft. For two da ys all was well. Mrs. \n",
      "van Daan knew what he was up to, but kept mum until Mr. van Daan f ound out about \n",
      "it. He threw a fit, took the book away and assumed that would be the end of the \n",
      "business. However, he'd neglected to take his son's curiosi ty into account. Peter, not \n",
      "in the least fazed by his father's swift action, began thinki ng up ways to read the rest \n",
      "of this vastly interesting book. \n",
      "In the meantime, Mrs. van D. asked Mother for her opinion. Mot her didn't think this \n",
      "particular book was suitable for Margot, but she saw no harm i n letting her read most \n",
      "other books. \n",
      "You see, Mrs. van Daan, Mother Said, there's a big difference between Margot and \n",
      "Peter. To begin with, Margot's a girl, and girls are always mo re mature than boys. \n",
      "Second, she's already read many serious books and doesn't go looking for those which \n",
      "are no longer forbidden. Third, Margot's much more sensible and intellectually \n",
      "advanced, as a result of her four years at an excellent school .\" \n",
      "Mrs. van Daan agreed with her, but felt it was wrong as a matter of principle to let \n",
      "youngsters read books written for adults. \n",
      "Meanwhile, Peter had thought of a suitable time when no one wo uld be interested in \n",
      "either him or the book. At seven-thirty in the evening, when t he entire family was \n",
      "listening to the radio in the private office, he took his trea sure and stole off to the \n",
      "loft again. He should have been back by eight-thirty, but he w as so engrossed in the \n",
      "book that he forgot the time and was just coming down the stair s when his father \n",
      "entered the room. The scene that followed was not surprising : after a slap, a whack \n",
      "and a tug-of-war, the book lay on the table and Peter was in the loft. \n",
      "This is how matters stood when it was time for the family to eat . Peter stayed \n",
      "upstairs. No one gave him a moment's thought; he'd have to go t o bed without his \n",
      "dinner. We continued eating, chatting merrily away, when su ddenly we heard a piercing \n",
      "whistle. We lay down our forks and stared at each other, the sh ock clearly visible on \n",
      "our pale faces. \n",
      "Then we heard Peter's voice through the chimney: \"I won t come down!\" Mr. van Daan leapt up, his napkin falling to the floor, and sho uted, with the blood \n",
      "rushing to his face, \"I've had enough!\" \n",
      "Father, afraid of what might happen, grabbed him by the arm an d the two men went \n",
      "to the attic. After much struggling and kicking, Peter wound up in his room with the \n",
      "door shut, and we went on eating. \n",
      "Mrs. van Daan wanted to save a piece of bread for her darling so n, but Mr. van D. \n",
      "was adamant. \"If he doesn't apologize this minute, he'll hav e to sleep in the loft.\" \n",
      "We protested that going without dinner was enough punishmen t. What if Peter were to \n",
      "catch cold? We wouldn't be able to call a doctor. \n",
      "Peter didn't apologize, and returned to the loft. \n",
      "Mr. van Daan decided to leave well enough alone, though he did note the next morning \n",
      "that Peter's bed had been slept in. At seven Peter went to the a ttic again, but was \n",
      "persuaded to come downstairs when Father spoke a few friendl y words to him. After \n",
      "three days of sullen looks and stubborn silence, everything was back to normal. \n",

      "through the grinder: once, twice, three times. Then he added the remaining ingredi \n",

      "We ate the bratwurst with sauerkraut for lunch, but the sausa ges, which were going \n",
      "to be canned, had to dry first, so we hung them over a pole suspe nded from the \n",
      "cethng. Everyone who came into the room burst into laughter w hen they saw the \n",
      "dangling sausages.It was such a comical sight. \n",
      "The kitchen was a shambles. Mr. van Daan, clad in his wife's ap ron and looking fatter \n",
      "than ever, was working away at the meat. What with his bloody h ands, red face and \n",
      "spotted apron, he looked like a real butcher. Mrs. D. was tryi ng to do everything at \n",
      "once: learning Dutch out of a book, stirring the soup, watchi ng the meat, sighing and \n",
      "moaning about her broken rib. That's what happens when old (! ) ladies do such stupid \n",
      "exercises to get rid of their fat behinds! Dussel had an eye in fection and was sitting \n",

      "sunshine coming through the window, kept having to move his c hair this way and that \n",

      "some eau de cologne, which could be used as a disinfectant, an d vaseline, which would \n",
      "have to do for wax. He looked in Mrs. van D.'s mouth and found tw o teeth that made \n",
      "her wince with pain and utter incoherent cries every time he t ouched them. After a lengthy examination (lengthy as far as Mrs. van D. was concer ned, since it actually \n",
      "took no longer than two minutes), Dussel began to scrape out a cavity. But Mrs. van \n",
      "D. had no intention of letting him. She flailed her arms and le gs until Dussel finally let \n",
      "go of his probe and it . . . remained stuck in Mrs. van D.'s tooth . That really did it! \n",
      "Mrs. van D. lashed out wildly in all directions, cried (as muc h as you can with an \n",
      "instrument like that in your mouth), tried to remove it, but o nly managed to push it \n",
      "in even farther. Mr. Dussel calmly observed the scene, his ha nds on his hips, while \n",
      "the rest of the audience roared with laughter. Of course, tha t was very mean of us. \n",
      "If it'd been me, I'm sure I would have yelled even louder. Afte r a great deal of \n",
      "squirming, kicking, screaming and shouting, Mrs. van D. fin ally managed to yank the \n",

      "so quick that Mrs. van D. didn't have time to pull any more shen anigans. But then, he \n",
      "had more help than he's ever had before: no fewer than two assi s tants; Mr. van D. \n",

      "on the next floor. Mr. van D. had a bad cold and had already gone to bed, so we \n",

      "conclusion that the burglars had taken to their heels when th ey heard footsteps in an \n",
      "otherwise quiet building. The problem now was that the chair s in the private office \n",
      "were neatly grouped around the radio, which was tuned to Engl and. If the burglars \n",
      "had forced the door and the air-raid wardens were to notice it and call the police, \n",
      "there could be very serious repercus sions. So Mr. van Daan go t up, pulled on his coat \n",
      "and pants, put on his hat and cautiously followed Father down the stairs, with Peter \n",
      "(armed with a heavy hammer, to be on the safe side) right behin d him. The ladies \n",

      "sure if he'd given Bep the key and she'd forgotten to lock the d oor. \n",
      "But that was of little importance now. The night had just begu n, and we still weren't \n",
      "sure what to expect. We were somewhat reassured by the fact th at between \n",
      "eight-fifteen -- when the burglar had first entered the buil ding and put our lives in \n",
      "jeopardy, and ten-thirty, we hadn't heard a sound. The more w e thought about it, the \n",

      "In Memoriam \n",
      "My fountain pen was always one of my most prized possessions; I valued it highly, \n",
      "especially because it had a thick nib, and I can only write nea tly with thick nibs. It \n",
      "has led a long and interesting fountain-pen life, which I wil l summarize below. \n",
      "When I was nine, my fountain pen (packed in cotton) arrived as a \"sample of no \n",
      "commercial value\" all the way from Aachen, where my grandmot her (the kindly donor) \n",
      "used to live. I lay in bed with the flu, while the February wind s howled around the \n",
      "apartment house. This splendid fountain pen came in a red lea ther case, and I showed \n",
      "it to my girlfriends the first chance I got. Me, Anne Frank, th e proud owner of a \n",
      "fountain pen. \n",
      "When I was ten, I was allowed to take the pen to school, and to my surprise, the \n",
      "teacher even let me write with it. When I was eleven, however, my treasure had to \n",
      "be tucked away again, because my sixth-grade teacher allowe d us to use only school \n",
      "pens and inkpots. When I was twelve, I started at the Jewish Ly ceum and my fountain \n",
      "pen was given a new case in honor of the occasion. Not only did i t have room for a \n",
      "pencil, it also had a zipper, which was much more impressive. When I was thirteen, \n",
      "the fountain pen went with me to the Annex, and together we've raced through \n",
      "countless diaries and compositions. I'd turned fourteen an d my fountain pen was \n",
      "enjoying the last year of its life with me when . . . \n",
      "It was just after five on Friday afternoon. I came out of my roo m and was about to \n",
      "sit down at the table to write when I was roughly pushed to one s ide to make room \n",
      "for Margot and Father, who wanted to practice their Latin. Th e fountain pen remained \n",
      "unused on the table, while its owner, sighing, was forced to m ake do with a very tiny \n",
      "corner of the table, where she began rubbing beans. That's ho w we remove mold from \n",
      "the beans and restore them to their original state. At a quart er to six I swept the \n",
      "floor, dumped the dirt into a news paper, along with the rotte n beans, and tossed it \n",
      "into the stove. A giant flame shot up, and I thought it was wond erful that the stove, \n",
      "which had been gasping its last breath, had made such a miracu lous recovery. \n",
      "All was quiet again. The Latin students had left, and I sat dow n at the table to pick up where I'd left off. But no matter where I looked, my fountai n pen was nowhere in \n",
      "sight. I took another look. Margot looked, Mother looked, Fa ther looked, Dussel looked. \n",
      "But it had vanished. \n",
      "\"Maybe it fell in the stove, along with the beans!\" Margot sug gested. \n",
      "\"No, it couldn't have!\" I replied. \n",
      "But that evening, when my fountain pen still hadn't turned up , we all assumed it had \n",
      "been burned, especially because celluloid is highly inflam mable. Our darkest fears were \n",
      "confirmed the next day when Father went to empty the stove and discovered the clip, \n",
      "used to fasten it to a pocket, among the ashes. Not a trace of th e gold nib was left. \n",
      "\"It must have melted into stone,\" Father conjectured. \n",

      "so strong that I had to admit to myself that the only reason I no longer liked him was \n",

      "Dearest Kitty, \n",
      "When I think back to my life in 1942, it all seems so unreal. The Anne Frank who \n",
      "enjoyed that heavenly existence was completely different f rom the one who has grown \n",
      "wise within these walls. Yes, it was heavenly. Five admirers on every street corner, \n",
      "twenty or so friends, the favorite of most of my teachers, spo iled rotten by Father \n",
      "and Mother, bags full of candy and a big allowance. What more c ould anyone ask for? \n",
      "You're probably wondering how I could have charmed all those people. Peter says It s \n",
      "ecause I m \"attractive,\" but that isn't it entirely. The teac hers were amused and \n",
      "entertained by my clever answers, my witty remarks, my smthn g face and my critical \n",
      "mind. That's all I was: a terrible flirt, coquettish and amus ing. I had a few plus points, \n",
      "which kept me in everybody's good graces: I was hardworking, honest and generous. I \n",
      "would never have refused anyone who wanted to peek at my answe rs, I was \n",
      "magnanimous with my candy, and I wasn't stuck-up. \n",
      "Would all that admiration eventually have made me overconfi dent? It's a good thing \n",
      "that, at the height of my glory, I was suddenly plunged into re ality. It took me more \n",
      "than a year to get used to doing without admiration. \n",
      "How did they see me at school? As the class comedian, the etern al ringleader, never \n",
      "in a bad mood, never a crybaby. Was it any wonder that everyone wanted to bicycle \n",
      "to school with me or do me little favors? \n",
      "I look back at that Anne Frank as a pleasant, amusing, but supe rficial girl, who has \n",
      "nothing to do with me. What did Peter say about me? \"Whenever I saw you, you were surrounded by a flock of girls and at least two boys, you were a lways laughing, and \n",
      "you were always the center of attention!\" He was right. \n",
      "What's remained of that Anne Frank? Oh, I haven't forgotten h ow to laugh or toss off \n",
      "a remark, I'm just as good, if not better, at raking people ove r the coals, and I can \n",
      "still flirt and be amusing, if I want to be . . . \n",
      "But there's the catch. I'd like to live that seemingly carefr ee and happy life for an \n",
      "evening, a few days, a week. At the end of that week I'd be exhau sted, and would be \n",
      "grateful to the first person to talk to me about something mea ningful. I want friends, \n",
      "not admirers. Peo- ple who respect me for my character and my d eeds, not my \n",
      "flattering smile. The circle around me would be much smaller , but what does that \n",
      "matter, as long as they're sincere? \n",
      "In spite of everything, I wasn't altogether happy in 1942; I o ften felt I'd been \n",
      "deserted, but because I was on the go all day long, I didn't thi nk about it. I enjoyed \n",

      "Looking back, I realize that this period of my life has irrevo cably come to a close; my \n",
      "happy-go-lucky, carefree schooldays are gone forever. I do n't even miss them. I've \n",
      "outgrown them. I can no longer just kid around, since my serio us side is always there. \n",
      "I see my life up to New Year's 1944 as if I were looking through a powerful \n",
      "magnifying glass. When I was at home, my life was filled with s unshine. Then, in the \n",
      "middle of 1942, everything changed overnight. The quarrels , the accusations -- I \n",
      "couldn't take it all in. I was caught off guard, and the only wa y I knew to keep my \n",
      "bearings was to talk back. \n",
      "The first half of 1943 brought crying spells, loneliness and the gradual realization of \n",
      "my faults and short- comings, which were numerous and seemed even more so. I \n",
      "filled the day with chatter, tried to draw Pim closer to me and failed. This left me on \n",
      "my own to face the difficult task of improving myself so I woul dn't have to hear their \n",
      "reproaches, because they made me so despondent. \n",
      "The second half of the year was slightly better. I became a tee nager, and was treated \n",
      "more like a grown-up. I began to think about things and to writ e stories, finally \n",
      "coming to the conclusion that the others no longer had anythi ng to do with me. They \n",
      "had no right to swing me back and forth like a pendulum on a cloc k. I wanted to \n",
      "change myself in my own way. I realized I could man- age withou t my mother, \n",
      "completely and totally, and that hurt. But what affected me e ven more was the realization that I was never going to be able to confide in Fat her. I didn't trust anyone \n",
      "but myself. \n",
      "After New Year's the second big change occurred: my dream, th rough which I \n",
      "discovered my longing for . . . a boy; not for a girlfriend, but for a boyfriend. I also \n",
      "discovered an inner happiness underneath my superficial an d cheerful exterior. From \n",
      "time to time I was quiet. Now I live only for Peter, since what h appens to me in the \n",
      "future depends largely on him! \n",
      "I lie in bed at night, after ending my prayers with the words \"I ch Janke air fur all das \n",

      "Schone. \n",
      "At such moments I don't think about all the misery, but about t he beauty that still \n",
      "remains. This is where Mother and I differ greatly. Her advic e in the face of \n",
      "melancholy is: \"Think about all the suffering in the world an d be thankful you're not \n",
      "part of it.\" My advice is: \"Go outside, to the country, enjoy t he sun and all nature has \n",
      "to offer. Go outside and try to recapture the happiness withi n yourself; think of all the \n",
      "beauty in yourself and in everything around you and be happy. \" \n",
      "I don't think Mother's advice can be right, because what are y ou supposed to do if \n",
      "you become part of the suffering? You'd be completely lost. O n the contrary, beauty \n",

      "Then I dreamed we were standing in Peter's room, facing each o ther beside the stairs. \n",
      "I said something to him; he gave me a kiss, but replied that he d idn't love me all that \n",
      "much and that I shouldn't flirt. In a desperate and pleading v oice I said, \"I'm not \n",
      "flirting, Peter!\" \n",

      "Last night I dreamed we were kissing each other, but \n",

      "After the dishes were done, I went to his room and asked if he'd refused the sausage \n",

      "First we talked about the quarrels and how I see them in a very d ifferent light these \n",
      "days, and then about how we've become alienated from our pare nts. I told Peter about \n",
      "Mother and Father and Margot and myself. At one point he asked , \"You always give \n",

      "\"No, I've never really kissed anyone.\" \n",

      "and I have only recently gotten to know each other and yet stil l tell each other very \n",
      "little, since we're always together. We talked about every i maginable thing, about \n",

      "Then we talked about the year 1942, and how different we were b ack then; we don't \n",

      "He'd thought I was a noisy pest, and I'd quickly concluded tha t he was nothing special. \n",
      "I didn't understand why he didn't flirt with me, but now I'm gl ad. He also mentioned \n",
      "how he often used to retreat to his room. I said that my noise an d exuberance and his \n",

      "see the back of me, starting with Mr. Dussel, and that I don't a lways want to sit with \n",

      "I am that he's here. \n",
      "How I now understand his need to withdraw and his relationshi p to his parents, and \n",

      "It was wonderful. He must have come to love me as a friend, and, for the time being, \n",

      "On the other hand, I'm certain I'd never have gotten as far wit h Peter, because I think \n",

      "Dear Anne, \n",
      "After your letter of yesterday I have the unpleasant feeling that your conscience \n",
      "bothers you whenever you go to Peter's to work or talk; there' s really no reason for \n",

      "I wouldn't be able to tolerate Peter in his place. \n",

      "may not develop at some later date, but it's certainly not rea ched that stage yet. So \n",
      "there's no need for you to feel sorry for me. Now that you've fo und companionship, \n",
      "enjoy it as much as you can. \n",
      "In the meantime, things are getting more and more wonderful h ere. I think, Kitty, that \n",

      "When he said I always helped him when his parents were arguing , I was tremendously \n",
      "happy; it was one step toward making me believe in his friends hip. I asked him \n",
      "yesterday what he'd do if there were a dozen Annes who kept pop ping in to see him. \n",
      "His answer was: \"If they were all like you, it wouldn't be so ba d.\" He's extremely \n",
      "hospitable, and I think he really likes to see me. Mean- while , he's been working hard \n",
      "at learning French, even studying in bed until ten-fifteen.\n",
      "Oh, when I think back to Saturday night, to our words, our voic es, I feel satisfied with \n",
      "myself for the very first time; what I mean is, I'd still say th e same and wouldn't want to change a thing, the way I usually do. He's so handsome, whether he's smthng \n",

      "Mr. Bolkestein, the Cabinet Minister, speaking on the Dutch broadcast from London, \n",
      "said that after the war a collection would be made of diaries a nd letters dealing with \n",
      "the war. Of course, everyone pounced on my diary. Just imagin e how interesting it \n",
      "would be if I were to publish a novel about the Secret Annex. Th e title alone would \n",
      "make people think it was a detective story. \n",
      "Seriously, though, ten years after the war people would find it very amusing to read \n",
      "how we lived, what we ate and what we talked about as Jews in hid ing. Although I \n",
      "tell you a great deal about our lives, you still know very litt le about us. How \n",
      "frightened the women are during air raids; last Sunday, for i nstance, when 350 British \n",
      "planes dropped 550 tons of bombs on IJmuiden, so that the hous es trembled like \n",
      "blades of grass in the wind. Or how many epidemics are raging h ere. \n",
      "You know nothing of these matters, and it would take me all day to describe \n",
      "everything down to the last detail. People have to stand in li ne to buy vegetables and \n",
      "all kinds of goods; doctors can't visit their patients, sinc e their cars and bikes are \n",
      "stolen the moment they turn their backs; burglaries and thef ts are so common that you ask yourself what's suddenly gotten into the Dutch to make th em so light-fingered. \n",
      "Little children, eight- and eleven- year-olds, smash the wi ndows of people's homes \n",
      "and steal whatever they can lay their hands on. People don't d are leave the house for \n",
      "even five minutes, since they're liable to come back and find all their belongings gone. \n",
      "Every day the newspapers are filled with reward notices for t he return of stolen \n",
      "typewriters, Persian rugs, electric clocks, fabrics, etc. The electric clocks on street \n",
      "corners are dismantled, public phones are stripped down to t he last wire. \n",
      "Morale among the Dutch can't be good. Everyone's hungry; exc ept for the ersatz \n",
      "coffee, a week's food ration doesn't last two days. The invas ion's long in coming, the \n",
      "men are being shipped off to Germany, the children are sick or undernourished, \n",
      "everyone's wearing worn-out clothes and run-down shoes. A n ew sole costs 7.50 \n",
      "guil- ders on the black market. Besides, few shoemakers will do repairs, or if they \n",
      "do, you have to wait four months for your shoes, which might ve ry well have \n",
      "disappeared in the meantime. \n",
      "One good thing has come out of this: as the food gets worse and t he decrees more \n",
      "severe, the acts of sabo- tage against the authorities are in creasing. The ration board, \n",
      "the police, the officials-they're all either helping their fellow citizens or denouncing \n",

      "Just imagine, it's still fairly cold, and yet most people hav e been without coal for \n",
      "nearly a month. Sounds awful, doesn't it? There's a general m ood of optimism about \n",
      "the Russian front, because that's going great guns! I don't o ften write about the \n",
      "political situation, but I must tell you where the Russians a re at the moment. They've \n",
      "reached the Polish border and the Prut River in Romania. They 're close to Odessa, and \n",
      "they've surrounded Ternopol. Every night we're expecting a n extra communique from \n",
      "Stalin. \n",
      "They're firing off so many salutes in Moscow, the city must be rumbling and shaking \n",

      "Hungary has been occupied by German troops. There are still a million Jews living there; they too are doom ed. \n",

      "last but not least, a cake with raspberry filling, slightly g luey because of the poor \n",
      "quality of the flour and the lack of butter, but deli- cious an yway. \n",
      "All that talk about Peter and me has died down a bit. He's comin g to pick me up \n",
      "tonight. Pretty nice of him, don't you think, since he hates d oing it! We're very good \n",
      "friends. We spend a lot of time together and talk about every i maginable subject. It's \n",
      "so nice not having to hold back when we come to a delicate topic , the way I would \n",
      "with other boys. For example, we were talking about blood and somehow the \n",
      "conversation turned to menstruation, etc. He thinks we wome n are quite tough to be \n",
      "able to withstand the loss of blood, and that I am too. I wonder why? \n",

      "I've got to stop, I've got to be calm. I'll try to be strong agai n, and if I'm patient, the \n",

      "here in the Annex, but in all of Holland, all of Europe and even beyond. \n",
      "In the twenty-one months we've lived here, we've been throug h a good many \"food \n",
      "cycles\" -- you'll understand what that means in a moment. A \"f ood cycle\" is a period \n",
      "in which we have only one particular dish or type of vegetable to eat. For a long time \n",
      "we ate nothing but endive. Endive with sand, endive without s and, endive with mashed \n",
      "potatoes, endive-and-mashed potato casserole. Then it was spinach, followed by \n",
      "kohlrabi, salsify, cucumbers, tomatoes, sauerkraut, etc. , etc. \n",
      "It's not much fun when you have to eat, say, sauer- kraut every day for lunch and \n",
      "dinner, but when you're hungry enough, you do a lot of things. Now, however, we're \n",
      "going through the most delightful period so far, because the re are no vegetables at all. \n",
      "Our weekly lunch menu consists of brown beans, split-pea sou p, potatoes with \n",
      "dumplings, potato kugel and, by the grace of God, turnip gree ns or rotten carrots, and \n",
      "then it's back to brown beans. Because of the bread shortage, we eat potatoes at \n",
      "every meal, starting with breakfast, but then we fry them a li ttle. To make soup we \n",
      "use brown beans, navy beans, potatoes, packages of vege- tab le soup, packages of \n",
      "chicken soup and packages of bean soup. There are brown beans in everything, \n",
      "including the bread. For dinner we always have potatoes with imitation gravy and -- \n",
      "thank goodness we've still got it -- beet salad. I must tell yo u about the dumplings. \n",
      "We make them with government-issue flour, water and yeast. T hey're so gluey and \n",
      "tough that it feels as if you had rocks in your stomach, but oh w ell! \n",
      "The high point is our weekly slice of liverwurst, and the jam o n our unbuttered bread. \n",

      "WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1944 My dearest Kitty, \n",
      "For a long time now I didn't know why I was bothering to do any sc hoolwork. The \n",
      "end of the war still seemed so far away, so unreal, like a fairy tale. If the war isn't \n",

      "behind. \n",
      "Peter filled my days, nothing but Peter, dreams and thoughts until Saturday night, \n",

      "cheerful and excited, but the minute I was alone I knew I was go ing to cry my eyes \n",
      "out. I slid to the floor in my nightgown and began by saying my p rayers, very \n",
      "fervently. Then I drew my knees to my chest, lay my head on my ar ms and cried, all \n",
      "huddled up on the bare floor. A loud sob brought me back down to earth, and I choked \n",
      "back my tears, since I didn't want anyone next door to hear me. Then I tried to pull \n",
      "myself together, saying over and over, \"I must, I must, I must . . . \" Stiff from sitting \n",
      "in such an unusual position, I fell back against the side of th e bed and kept up my \n",
      "struggle until just before ten-thirty, when I climbed back i nto bed. It was over! \n",
      "And now it's really over. I finally realized that I must do my s choolwork to keep from \n",
      "being ignorant, to get on in life, to become a journalist, bec ause that's what I want! I \n",
      "know I can write. A few of my stories are good, my descriptions of the Secret Annex \n",
      "are humorous, much of my diary is vivid and alive, but. . . it re mains to be seen \n",
      "whether I really have talent. \n",
      "\"Eva's Dream\" is my best fairy tale, and the odd thing is that I don't have the faintest \n",
      "idea where it came from. Parts of \"Cady's Life\" are also good, but as a whole it's \n",
      "nothing special. I'm my best and harshest critic. I know what 's good and what isn't. \n",
      "Unless you write yourself, you can't know how wonderful it is ; I always used to \n",
      "bemoan the fact that I couldn't draw, but now I'm overjoyed th at at least I can write. \n",
      "And if I don't have the talent to write books or newspaper arti cles, I can always write \n",

      "Mother, Mrs. van Daan and all the women who go about their work and are then \n",
      "forgotten. I need to have something besides a husband and chi ldren to devote myself \n",
      "to! I don't want to have lived in vain like most people. I want t o be useful or bring \n",

      "I can use to develop myself and to express all that's inside me ! \n",
      "When I write I can shake off all my cares. My sor- row disappear s, my spirits are revived! But, and that's a big question, will I ever be able to write something great, \n",
      "will I ever become a journalist or a writer? \n",
      "I hope so, oh, I hope so very much, because writing allows me to record everything, \n",
      "all my thoughts, ideals and fantasies. \n",
      "I haven't worked on \"Cady's Life\" for ages. In my mind I've wor ked out exactly what \n",
      "happens next, but the story doesn't seem to be coming along ve ry well. I might never \n",
      "finish it, and it'll wind up in the wastepaper basket or the st ove. That's a horrible \n",
      "thought, but then I say to myself, \"At the age of fourteen and w ith so little \n",
      "experience, you can't write about philosophy.\" \n",

      "First of all: writing, but I don't really think of that as a hob by. \n",
      "Number two: genealogical charts. I'm looking in every newsp aper, book and document I \n",
      "can find for the family trees of the French, German, Spanish, English, Austrian, \n",
      "Russian, Norwegian and Dutch royal famthes. I've made great progress with many of \n",

      "TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1944 \n",
      "My dearest Kitty, \n",
      "My head's in a whirl, I really don't know where to begin. Thurs day (the last time I \n",
      "wrote you) everything was as usual. Friday afternoon (Good F riday) we played \n",
      "Monopoly; Saturday afternoon too. The days passed very quic kly. Around two o'clock \n",
      "on Saturday, heavy firing ii began-machine guns, according to the men. For the rest, \n",
      "everything was quiet. \n",
      "Sunday afternoon Peter came to see me at four-thirty, at my in vitation. At \n",
      "five-fifteen we went to the Ii front attic, where we stayed un til six. There was a \n",
      "beautil ful Mozart concert on the radio from six to seven-fif teen; I especially enjoyed \n",
      "the Kleine Nachtmusik. I can hardly bear to listen in the kitc hen, since beautiful music \n",
      "stirs me to the very depths of my soul. Sunday evening Peter co uldn't take his balli, \n",
      "because the washtub was down in the office kitchen, filled wi th laundry. The two of \n",
      "us went to the front attic together, and in order to be able to s it comfortably, I took \n",
      "along the only cushion I could find in my room. We seated ourse lves on a packing \n",
      "crate. Since both the crate and the cushion were very narrow, we were sitting quite \n",
      "close, leaning against two other crates; Mouschi kept us com pany, so we weren't \n",
      "without a chaperon. Suddenly, at a quarter to nine, Mr. van Da an whistled and asked if \n",
      "we had Mr. Dussel's cushion. We jumped up and went downstairs willi the cushion, the \n",
      "cat and Mr. van Daan. This cushion was the source of much miser y. Dussel was angry \n",
      "because I'd taken the one he uses as a pillow, and he was afraid it might be covered \n",
      "with fleas; he had the entire house in an uproar because of thi s one cushion. In \n",
      "revenge, Peter and I stuck two hard brushes in his bed, but had to take them out \n",
      "again when Dussel unexpectedly decided to go sit in his room. We had a really good \n",
      "laugh at this little intermezzo. \n",
      "But our fun was short-lived. At nine-thirty Peter knocked ge ntly on the door and \n",
      "asked Father to come upstairs and help him with a difficult En glish sentence. \n",
      "\"That sounds fishy,\" I said to Margot. \"It's obviously a pret ext. You can tell by the \n",
      "way the men are talking that there's been a break-in!\" I was ri ght. The warehouse \n",
      "was being broken into at that very moment. Father, Mr. van Daa n and Peter were downstairs in a flash. Margot, Mother, Mrs. van D. and I waite d. Four frightened \n",
      "women need to talk, so that's what we did until we heard a bang d ownstairs. After \n",
      "that all was quiet. The clock struck quarter to ten. The color had drained from our \n",
      "faces, but we remained calm, even though we were afraid. Wher e were the men? What \n",
      "was that bang? Were they fighting with the burglars? We were t oo scared to think; all \n",
      "we could do was wait. \n",
      "Ten o'clock, footsteps on the stairs. Father, pale and nervo us, came inside, followed \n",
      "by Mr. van Daan. \"Lights out, tiptoe upstairs, we're expecti ng the police!\" There \n",
      "wasn't time to be scared. The lights were switched off, I grab bed a jacket, and we sat \n",
      "down upstairs. \n",
      "\"What happened? Tell us quickly!\" \n",
      "There was no one to tell us; the men had gone back downstairs. T he four of them \n",
      "didn't come back up until ten past ten. Two of them kept watch a t Peter's open \n",
      "window. The door to the landing was locked, the book- case shu t. We draped a \n",
      "sweater over our night-light, and then they told us what had h appened: \n",
      "Peter was on the landing when he heard two loud bangs. He went d ownstairs and saw \n",
      "that a large panel was missing from the left half of the wareho use door. He dashed \n",
      "upstairs, alerted the \"Home Guard,\" and the four of them went downstairs. When they \n",
      "entered the warehouse, the burglars were going about their b usiness. Without thinking, \n",
      "Mr. van Daan yelled \"Police!\" Hur- ried footsteps outside; t he burglars had fled. The \n",
      "board was put back in the door so the police wouldn't notice th e gap, but then a swift \n",
      "kick from outside sent it flying to the floor. The men were ama zed at the burglars' \n",
      "audacity. Both Peter and Mr. van Daan felt a murderous rage co me over them. Mr. van \n",
      "Daan slammed an ax against the floor, and all was quiet again. Once more the panel \n",
      "was re- placed, and once more the attempt was foiled. Outside , a man and a woman \n",
      "shone a glaring flashlight through the opening, lighting up the entire warehouse. \"What \n",
      "the . . .\" mumbled one of the men, but now their roles had been re versed. Instead of \n",
      "policemen, they were now burglars. All four of them raced ups tairs. Dussel and Mr. \n",
      "van Daan snatched up Dussel's books, Peter opened the doors a nd windows in the \n",
      "kitchen and private office, hurled the phone to the ground, a nd the four of them finally \n",
      "ended up behind the bookcase. \n",
      "END OF PART ONE \n",
      "In all probability the man and woman with the flashlight had a lerted the police. It was \n",
      "Sunday night, Easter Sunday. The next day, Easter Monday, th e office was going to \n",
      "be closed, which meant we wouldn't be able to move around unti l Tuesday morning. Think of it, having to sit in such terror for a day and two night s! We thought of \n",
      "nothing, but simply sat there in pitch darkness -- in her fear , Mrs. van D. had \n",
      "switched off the lamp. We whispered, and every time we heard a creak, someone said, \n",
      "\"Shh, shh.\" \n",
      "It was ten-thirty, then eleven. Not a sound. Father and Mr. va n Daan took turns \n",
      "coming upstairs to us. Then, at eleven-fifteen, a noise belo w. Up above you could \n",
      "hear the whole family breathing. For the rest, no one moved a m uscle. Footsteps in \n",
      "the house, the private office, the kitchen, then. . . on the st aircase. All sounds of \n",
      "breathing stopped, eight hearts pounded. Foot- steps on the stairs, then a rattling at \n",
      "the bookcase. This moment is indescribable. \n",
      "\"Now we're done for,\" I said, and I had visions of all fifteen o f us being dragged away \n",
      "by the Gestapo that very night. \n",
      "More rattling at the bookcase, twice. Then we heard a can fall , and the footsteps \n",
      "receded. We were out of danger, so far! A shiver went though ev eryone's body, I \n",
      "heard several sets of teeth chattering, no one said a word. We stayed like this until \n",
      "eleven-thirty. \n",
      "There were no more sounds in the house, but a light was shining on our landing, right \n",
      "in front of the bookcase. Was that because the police thought it looked so suspicious \n",
      "or because they simply forgot? Was anyone going to come back a nd turn it off? We \n",
      "found our tongues again. \n",
      "There were no longer any people inside the building, but perh aps someone was \n",
      "standing guard outside. We then did three things: tried to gu ess what was going on, \n",
      "trembled with fear and went to the bathroom. Since the bucket s were in the attic, all \n",
      "we had was Peter's metal wastepaper basket. Mr. van Daan went first, then Father, \n",
      "but Mother was too embarrassed. Father brought the waste- ba sket to the next room, \n",
      "where Margot, Mrs. van Daan and I gratefully made use of it. Mo ther finally gave in. \n",
      "There was a great demand for paper, and luckily I had some in my pocket. \n",
      "The wastebasket stank, everything went on in a whisper, and w e were exhausted. It \n",
      "was midnight. \n",
      "\"Lie down on the floor and go to sleep!\" Margot and I were each g iven a pillow and a \n",
      "blanket. Margot lay down near the food cupboard, and I made my bed between the \n",
      "table legs. The smell wasn't quite so bad when you were lying o n the floor, but Mrs. \n",
      "van Daan quietly went and got some powdered bleach and draped a dish towel over \n",

      "Jan and Miep were of course greeted with shouts and tears. Jan nailed a pinewood \n",

      "So we had half an hour in which to put the house and ourselves to rights. I've never \n",
      "seen such a transformation as in those thirty minutes. Margo t and I got the beds \n",
      "ready downstairs, went to the bathroom, brushed our teeth, w ashed our hands and \n",
      "combed our hair. Then I straightened up the room a bit and went back upstairs. The \n",
      "table had already been cleared, so we got some water, made cof fee and tea, boiled the \n",
      "milk and set the table. Father and Peter emptied our improvis ed potties and rinsed \n",
      "them with warm water and powdered bleach. The largest one was filled to the brim \n",
      "and was so heavy they had a hard time lifting it. To make things worse, it was \n",

      "At eleven o'clock Jan was back and joined us at the table, and g radually everyone \n",
      "began to relax. Jan had the following story to tell: \n",
      "Mr. Sleegers was asleep, but his wife told Jan that her husban d had discovered the \n",
      "hole in the door while making his rounds. He called in a police man, and the two of \n",
      "them searched the building. Mr. Sleegers, in his capacity as night watchman, patrols \n",
      "the area every night on his bike, accompanied by his two dogs. His wife said he would \n",
      "come on Tuesday and tell Mr. Kugler the rest. No one at the poli ce station seemed to \n",
      "know anything about the break-in, but they made a note to come first thing Tuesday \n",
      "morning to have a look. \n",
      "On the way back Jan happened to run into Mr. van Hoeven, the man who supplies us \n",
      "with potatoes, and told him of the break-in. \"I know,\" Mr. van Hoeven calmly replied. \n",
      "\"Last night when my wife and I were walking past your building , I saw a gap in the \n",
      "door. My wife wanted to walk on, but I peeked inside with a flas hlight, and that's \n",
      "when the burglars must have run off. To be on the safe side, I di dn't call the police. I \n",
      "thought it wouldn't be wise in your case. I don't know anythin g, but I have my \n",

      "here, because he always delivers the potatoes at lunchtime. A decent man! \n",
      "It was one o'clock by the time Jan left and we'd done the dishes . All eight of us went \n",
      "to bed. I woke up at quarter to three and saw that Mr. Dussel was already up. My \n",
      "face rumpled with sleep, I happened to run into Peter in the ba throom, just after he'd come downstairs. We agreed to meet in the office. I freshened up a bit and went \n",
      "down. \n",
      "\"After all this, do you still dare go to the front attic?\" he as ked. I nodded, grabbed \n",
      "my pillow, with a cloth wrapped around it, and we went up toget her. The weather was \n",
      "gorgeous, and even though the air-raid sirens soon began to w ail, we stayed where \n",
      "we were. Peter put his arm around my shoulder, I put mine aroun d his, and we sat \n",
      "quietly like this until four o'clock, when Margot came to get us for coffee. \n",
      "We ate our bread, drank our lemonade and joked (we were finall y able to again), and \n",

      "been the bravest of us all. \n",
      "None of us have ever been in such danger as we were that night. G od was truly \n",

      "my arms around his neck and kissed him on his left cheek. I was a bout to kiss the \n",

      "I had last night. The gentle Anne makes infrequent appearanc es, and she's not about \n",
      "to let herself be shoved out the door so soon after she's arriv ed. Peter's reached a \n",
      "part of me that no one has ever reached before, except in my dre am! He's taken hold \n",
      "of me and turned me inside out. Doesn't everyone need a little quiet time to put \n",

      "from me? \n",
      "Where will this lead? Oh, now I understand Bep. Now, now that I 'm going through it \n",
      "myself, I understand her doubts; if I were older and he wanted to marry me, what \n",
      "would my answer be? Anne, be honest! You wouldn't be able to ma rry him. But it's so \n",
      "hard to let go. Peter still has too little character, too litt le willpower, too little \n",
      "courage and strength. He's still a child, emotionally no old er than I am; all he wants is \n",

      "I'm afraid of myself, afraid my longing is making me yield too soon. How can it ever \n",

      "we'd discussed it, he said he thought I should. I was glad; it s hows he's sensible, and \n",
      "sensitive. As soon as I came downstairs, I went with Father to get some water. While \n",
      "we were on the stairs, I said, \"Father, I'm sure you've gather ed that when Peter and I \n",

      "\"Of course not,\" I answered. \n",
      "\"Well, you know I understand both of you. But you must be the on e to show restraint; \n",
      "don't go upstairs so often, don't encourage him more than you can help. In matters \n",
      "like these, it's always the man who takes the active role, and it's up to the woman to \n",
      "set the limits. Outside, where you're free, things are quite different. You see other \n",
      "boys and girls, you can go outdoors, take part in sports and al l kinds of activities. But \n",
      "here, if you're together too much and want to get away, you can 't. You see each other \n",
      "every hour of the day-all the time, in fact. Be careful, Anne, and don't take it too \n",
      "seriously! \n",
      "\"I don't, Father, but Peter's a decent boy, a nice boy.\" \n",
      "\"Yes, but he doesn't have much strength of character. He can e asily be influenced to \n",
      "do good, but also to do bad. I hope for his sake that he stays goo d, because he's \n",
      "basically a good person.\" We talked some more and agreed that Father would speak to him t oo. \n",
      "Sunday afternoon when we were in the front attic, Peter asked , \"Have you talked to \n",

      "\"Yes,\" I replied, \"I'll tell you all about it. He doesn't thin k it's wrong, but he says that \n",

      "\"We've already agreed not to quarrel, and I plan to keep my pro mise.\" \n",
      "\"Me too, Peter. But Father didn't think we were serious, he th ought we were just \n",
      "friends. Do you think we still can be?\" \n",
      "\"Yes, I do. How about you?\" \n",
      "\"Me too. I also told Father that I trust you. I do trust you, Pet er, just as much as I \n",
      "do Father. And I think you're worthy of my trust. You are, aren 't you?\" \n",
      "\"I hope so.\" (He was very shy, and blushing.) \n",
      "\"I believe in you, Peter,\" I continued. \"I believe you have a g ood character and that \n",
      "you'll get ahead in this world.\" \n",
      "After that we talked about other things. Later I said, \"If we e ver get out of here, I \n",

      "Just then somebody called us. \n",
      "Father did talk to him, he told me Monday. \"Your Father though t our friendship might \n",

tracks a real brat admirer appie riem is pretty orthodox but a brat too saturday june 201942 writing in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me not only because ive never written anything before but also becaus e it seems to me that later on neither i nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteenyearold schoolgirl oh well it doesnt matter i feel like writing and i have an even greater need to get all kinds of things off my chest paper has more patience than people i thought of this sayi ng on one of those days when i was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home w ith my chin in my hands bored and listless wondering whether to stay in or go out i finally stayed where i was brooding yes paper does have more patience an d since im not planning to let anyone else read this stiffbacked notebook grandly r eferred to as a diary unless i should ever find a real friend it probably wont mak e a bit of difference now im back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place i dont have a friend let me put it more clearly since no one will believe that a thi rteen yearold girl is completely alone in the world and im not i have loving pare nts and a sixteenyearold sister and there are about thirty people i can call friends i have a throng of admirers who cant keep their adoring eyes off me an d who sometimes have to resort to using a broken pocket mirror to try and catch a gli mpse of me in the classroom i have a family loving aunts and a good home no o n the surface i seem to have everything except my one true friend all i think abo ut when im with friends is having a good time i cant bring myself to talk about anyth ing but ordinary everyday things we dont seem to be able to get any closer an d thats the problem maybe its my fault that we dont confide in each other in any case thats just how things are and unfortunately theyre not liable to change this is why ive started the diary to enhance the image of this longawaited friend in my imagin ation i dont want to jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do b ut i want the diary to be my friend and im going to call this friend kitty since no one would understand a word of my stories to kitty if i were to plunge right in id better provide a brief sketch of my life much as i disl ike doing so my father the most adorable father ive ever seen didnt ma rry my mother until he was thirtysix and she was twentyfive my sister margot was born in frankfurt am main in germany in 1926 i was born on june 12 1929 i lived in f rankfurt until i was four because were jewish my father immigrated to holl and in 1933 when he became the managing director of the dutch opekta company wh ich manufactures products used in making jam my mother edith hollander fran k went with him to holland in september while margot and i were sent to aachen t o stay with our grandmother margot went to holland in december and i follo wed in february when i was plunked down on the table as a birthday present for margot i started right away at the montessori nursery school i stay ed there until i was six at which time i started first grade in sixth grade my teacher was mrs kuperus the principal at the end of the year we were both in tears as we sai d a heartbreaking farewell because id been accepted at the jewish lyceum wh ere margot also went to school our lives were not without anxiety since our relatives in ge rmany were suffering under hitlers antijewish laws after the pogroms in 1938 m y two uncles my mothers brothers fled germany finding safe refuge in nor th america my elderly grandmother came to live with us she was seventythree year s old at the time after may 1940 the good times were few and far between first t here was the war then the capitulation and then the arrival of the germans wh ich is when the trouble started for the jews our freedom was severely restricted by a series of antijewish decrees jews were required to wear a yellow star jews were r equired to turn in their bicycles jews were forbidden to use streetcars jew s were forbidden to ride in cars even their own jews were required to do their shopping between 3 and 5 pm jews were required to frequent only jewishowned barbersho ps and beauty parlors jews were forbidden to be out on the streets between 8 pm and 6 am jews were forbidden to attend theaters movies or any other forms of en tertainment jews were forbidden to use swimming pools tennis courts hockey fiel ds or any other athletic fields jews were forbidden to go rowing jews were forbidde n to take part in any athletic activity in public jews were forbidden to sit in th eir gardens or those of their friends after 8 pm jews were forbidden to visit christian s in their homes jews were required to attend jewish schools etc you couldnt do this and you couldnt do that but life went on jacque always said to me i dont dare do anything anymore cause im afraid its not allowed in the summer of 1941 grandma got sick and had to have an operat ion so my birthday passed with little celebration in the summer of 19 40 we didnt do much for my birthday either since the fighting had just ended in holl and grandma died in january 1942 no one knows how often i think of her and still lo ve her this birthday celebration in 1942 was intended to make up for the others an d grandmas candle was lit along with the rest the four of us are still doing well and that brings me to the pr esent date of june 20 1942 and the solemn dedication of my diary saturday june 20 1942 dearest kitty let me get started right away its nice and qu iet now father and mother are out and margot has gone to play pingpong with some other young people at her friend treess ive been playing a lot of pingpong my self lately so much that five of us girls have formed a club its called the litt le dipper minus two a really silly name but its based on a mistake we wanted to gi ve our club a special name and because there were five of us we came up with the ide a of the little dipper we thought it consisted of five stars but we turned o ut to be wrong it has seven like the big dipper which explains the minus two i lse wagner has a pingpong set and the wagners let us play in their big dining room whenever we want since we five pingpong players like ice cream especi ally in the summer and since you get hot playing pingpong our games usually end wi th a visit to the nearest icecream parlor that allows jews either oasis or d elphi weve long since stopped hunting around for our purses or money most of the t ime its so busy in oasis that we manage to find a few generous young men of our acq uaintance or an admirer to offer us more ice cream than we could eat in a week youre probably a little surprised to hear me talking about a dmirers at such a tender age unfortunately or not as the case may be this vice seem s to be rampant at our school as soon as a boy asks if he can bicycle home with me and w e get to talking nine times out of ten i can be sure hell become enamored on the spot and wont let me out of his sight for a second his ardor eventually cools e specially since i ignore his passionate glances and pedal blithely on my way if it get s so bad that they start rambling on about asking fathers permission i swerve sl ightly on my bike my schoolbag falls and the young man feels obliged to get off hi s bike and hand me the bag by which time ive switched the conversation to another topic these are the most innocent types of course there are those who blow you k isses or try to take hold of your arm but theyre definitely knocking on the wron g door i get off my bike and either refuse to make further use of their company or act a s if im insulted and tell them in no uncertain terms to go on home without me there you are weve now laid the basis for our friendship until tomorrow yours anne sunday june 21 1942 dearest kitty our entire class is quaking in its boots the reason of cours e is the upcoming meeting in which the teachers decide wholl be promoted to th e next grade and wholl be kept back half the class is making bets gz and i laugh ou rselves sick at the two boys behind us cn and jacques kocernoot who have staked t heir entire vacation savings on their bet from morning to night its youre goi ng to pass no im not yes you are no im not even gs pleading glances and my angry outbursts cant calm them down if you ask me there are so many dummies that ab out a quarter of the class should be kept back but teachers are the most unpre dictable creatures on earth maybe this time theyll be unpredictable in the right direction for a change im not so worried about my girlfriends and myself well make it the only subject im not sure about is math any way all we can do is wait until then we keep telling each other not to lose heart i get along pretty well with all my teachers there are nine of them seven men and two women mr keesing the old fogey who teaches math was ma d at me for the longest time because i talked so much after several warning s he assigned me extra homework an essay on the subject a chatterbox a chatterb ox what can you write about that id wbrry about that later i decided i jotted do wn the assignment in my notebook tucked it in my bag and tried to keep quiet that evening after id finished the rest of my homework the note about the essay caught my eye i began thinking about the subject while chewi ng the tip of my fountain pen anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces bet ween the words but the trick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the ne cessity of talking i thought and thought and suddenly i had an idea i wrote the th ree pages mr keesing had assigned me and was satisfied i argued that talking is a f emale trait and that i would do my best to keep it under control but that i would neve r be able to break myself of the habit since my mother talked as much as i did if not more and that theres not much you can do about inherited traits mr keesing had a good laugh at my arguments but when i procee ded to talk my way through the next class he assigned me a second essay this ti me it was supposed to be on an incorrigible chatterbox i handed it in and mr ke esing had nothing to complain about for two whole classes however during the th ird class hed finally had enough anne frank as punishment for talking in class wri te an essay entitled quack quack quack said mistress chatterback the class roared i had to laugh too though id nearly exhau sted my ingenuity on the topic of chatterboxes it was time to come up with somethi ng else j something original my friend sanne whos good at poetry offered to h elp me write the essay from beginning to end in verse i jumped for joy keesing was t rying to play a joke on me with this ridiculous subject but id make sure the joke wa s on him i finished my poem and it was beautiful it was about a mother duck and a fat her swan with three baby ducklings who were bitten to death by the father because they quacked too much luckily keesing took the joke the right way he read th e poem to the class adding his own comments and to several other classes as well since then ive been allowed to talk and havent been assigned any extra homework on the contrary keesings always i making jokes these days yours anne wednesday june 24 1942 dearest kitty its sweltering everyone is huffing and puffing and in thi s heat i have to walk everywhere only now do i realize how pleasant a streetcar is but we jews are no longer allowed to make use of this luxury our own two feet are good enough for us yesterday at lunchtime i had an appointment with the dentist on jan luykenstraat its a long way from our school on stadstimmertuinen that aftern oon i nearly fell asleep at my desk fortunately people automatically offer you som ething to drink the dental assistant is really kind the only mode of transportation left to us is the ferry the fe rryman at josef israelkade took us across when we asked him to its not the fa ult of the dutch that we jews are having such a bad time i wish i didnt have to go to school my bike was stolen during e aster vacation and father gave mothers bike to some christian friends for safe keeping thank goodness summer vacation is almost here one more week and our torment will be over something unexpected happened yesterday morning as i was p assing the bicycle racks i heard my name being called i turned around and there was the nice boy id met the evening before at my friend wilmas hes wilmas sec ond cousin i used to think wilma was nice which she is but all she ever talks abou t is boys and that gets to be a bore he came toward me somewhat shyly and introduce d himself as hello silberberg i was a little surprised and wasnt sure what he w anted but it didnt take me long to find out he asked if i would allow him to accompany m e to school as long as youre headed that way ill go with you i said and s o we walked together hello is sixteen and good at telling all kinds of funny storie s he was waiting for me again this morning and i expect he will b e from now on anne wednesday july 1 1942 dearest kitty until today i honestly couldnt find the time to write you i w as with friends all day thursday we had company on friday and thats how it went unt il today hello and i have gotten to know each other very well this past w eek and hes told me a lot about his life he comes from gelsenkirchen and is liv ing with his grandparents his parents are in belgium but theres no way he can get there hello used to have a girlfriend named ursula i know her too shes p erfectly sweet and perfectly boring ever since he met me hello has realized th at hes been falling asleep at ursuls side so im kind of a pep tonic you never know what youre good for jacque spent saturday night here sunday afternoon she was a t hannelis and i was bored stiff hello was supposed to come over that evening but he called ar ound six i answered the phone and he said this is helmuth silberberg may i ple ase speak to anne oh hello this is anne oh hi anne how are you fine thanks i just wanted to say im sorry but i cant come tonight thoug h i would like to have a word with you is it all right if i come by and pick you up in abou t ten minutes yes thats fine byebye okay ill be right over byebye i hung up quickly changed my clothes and fixed my hair i was s o nervous i leaned out the window to watch for him he finally showed up miracle of miracles i didnt rush down the stairs but waited quietly until he rang the bel l i went down to open the door and he got right to the point anne my grandmother thinks youre too young for me to be see ing you on a regular basis she says i should be going to the lowenbachs but you p robably know that im not going out with ursul anymore no i didnt know what happened did you two have a fight no nothing like that i told ursul that we werent suited to each other and so it was better for us not to go together anymore but that she was welc ome at my house and i hoped i would be welcome at hers actually i thought ursul w as hanging around with another boy and i treated her as if she were but that was nt true and then my uncle said i should apologize to her but of course i didnt fe el like it and thats why i broke up with her but that was just one of the reasons now my grandmother wants me to see ursul and not you but i don t agree and im not going to sometimes old people have really oldfashione d ideas but that doesnt mean i have to go along with them i need my grandparents but i n a certain sense they need me too from now on ill be free on wednesday evening s you see my grandparents made me sign up for a woodcarving class but ac tually i go to a club organized by the zionists my grandparents dont want me to g o because theyre antizionists im not a fanatic zionist but it interests m e anyway its been such a mess lately that im planning to quit so next wednesday will be my last meeting that means i can see you wednesday evening saturday afterno on saturday evening sunday afternoon and maybe even more but if your grandparents dont want you to you shouldnt g o behind their backs alls fair in love and war just then we passed blankevoorts bookstore and there was pe ter schiff with two other boys it was the first time hed said hello to me in ages and it really made me feel good monday evening hello came over to meet father and mother i ha d bought a cake and some candy and we had tea and cookies the works but neither hello nor i felt like sitting stiffly on our chairs so we went out for a walk and he didnt deliver me to my door until ten past eight father was furious he said it wa s very wrong of me not to get home on time i had to promise to be home by ten to eight in the future ive been asked to hellos on saturday wilma told me that one night when hello was at her house she as ked him who do you like best ursul or anne he said its none of your business but as he was leaving they hadnt talked to each other the res t of the evening he said well i like anne better but dont tell anyone bye and whoosh he was out the door in everything he says or does i can see that hello is in love wi th me and its kind of nice for a change margot would say that hello is eminently suitable i think so too but hes more than that mother is also full of praise a good looking boy nice and polite im glad hes so popular with everyone except with my girlfriends he thinks theyre very childish and hes right about that jacque sti ll teases me about him but im not in love with him not really its all right for me to ha ve boys as friends nobody minds mother is always asking me who im going to marry when i grow up but i bet shell never guess its peter because i talked her out of that idea m yself without batting an eyelash i love peter as ive never loved anyone and i tell my self hes only going around with all those other girls to hide his feelings for me maybe he thinks hello and i are in love with each other which were not hes just a f riend or as mother puts it a beau yours anne sunday july 5 1942 dear kitty the graduation ceremony in the jewish theater on friday went as expected my report card wasnt too bad i got one d a c in algebra and all t he rest bs except for two bs and two bs my parents are pleased but theyre not like other parents when it comes to grades they never worry about report cards good or bad as long as im healthy and happy and dont talk back too much theyre satisfied if these three things are all right everything else will take care of itsel f im just the opposite i dont want to be a poor student i was a ccepted to the jewish lyceum on a conditional basis i was supposed to stay in the se venth grade at the montessori school but when jewish children were required t o go to jewish schools mr elte finally agreed after a great deal of persuasion to accept lies goslar and me lies also passed this year though she has to repeat her geome try exam poor lies it isnt easy for her to study at home her baby sist er a spoiled little twoyearold plays in her room all day if gabi doesnt get h er way she starts screaming and if lies doesnt look after her mrs goslar st arts screaming so lies has a hard time doing her homework and as long as thats the ca se the tutoring shes been getting wont help much the goslar household is really a sight mrs goslars parents live next door but eat with the family the theres a hired girl the baby the always absentminded and absent mr goslar and the always ner vous and irrita ie mrs goslar whos expecting another baby lies whos all thumb s gets lost in the mayhem my sister margot has also gotten her report card brilliant as usual if we had such a thing as cum laude she would have passed with honors shes so smart father has been home a lot lately theres nothing for him to d o at the office it must be awful to feel youre not needed mr kleiman has taken over opekta and mr kugler gies co the company dealing in spices and spice su bstitutes that was set up in 1941 a few days ago as we were taking a stroll around our neighborh ood square father began to talk about going into hiding he said it would be very hard for us to live cut off from the rest of the world i asked him why he was bringing t his up now well anne he replied you know that for more than a year w eve been bringing clothes food and furniture to other people we dont want ou r belongings to be seized by the germans nor do we want to fall into their clutches ours elves so well leave of our own accord and not wait to be hauled away but when father he sounded so serious that i felt scared dont you worry well take care of everything just enjoy y our carefree life while you can that was it oh may these somber words not come true for as lon g as possible the doorbells ringing hellos here time to stop yours anne wednesday july 8 1942 dearest kitty it seems like years since sunday morning so much has happene d its as if the whole world had suddenly turned upside down but as you can see kit ty im still alive and thats the main thing father says im alive all right but d ont ask where or how you probably dont understand a word im saying today so ill be gin by telling you what happened sunday afternoon at three oclock hello had left but was supposed to come back later the doorbell rang i didnt hear it since i was out on the balcony lazily r eading in the sun a little while later margot appeared in the kitchen doorway looking v ery agitated father has received a callup notice from the ss she whispered moth er has gone to see mr van daan mr van daan is fathers business partner and a goo d friend i was stunned a callup everyone knows what that means vis ions of concentration camps and lonely cells raced through my head how could we let father go to such a fate of course hes not going declared margot as we waite d for mother in the living room mothers gone to mr van daan to ask whether we c an move to our hiding place tomorrow the van daans are going with us there will be seven of us altogether silence we couldnt speak the thought of fat her off visiting someone in the jewish hospital and completely unaware of what was happe ning the long wait for mother the heat the suspense all this reduced us to silen ce suddenly the doorbell rang again thats hello i said dont open the door exclaimed margot to stop me but it was nt necessary since we heard mother and mr van daan downstairs talking to hello and then the two of them came inside and shut the door behind them every time the bell rang either margot or i had to tiptoe downstairs to see if it was father an d we didnt let anyone else in margot and i were sent from the room as mr van daan wa nted to talk to mother alone when she and i were sitting in our bedroom margot told me that the callup was not for father but for her at this second shock i began to cry m argot is sixteen apparently they want to send girls her age away on their own b ut thank goodness she wont be going mother had said so herself which must be what father had meant when he talked to me about our going into hiding hiding wh ere would we hide in the city in the country in a house in a shack when where h ow these were questions i wasnt allowed to ask but they still kept ru nning through my mind margot and i started packing our most important belongings i nto a schoolbag the first thing i stuck in was this diary and then curlers handkerchi efs schoolbooks a comb and some old letters preoccupied by the thought of going int o hiding i stuck the craziest things in the bag but im not sorry memories mean m ore to me than dresses father finally came hqme around five oclock and we called m r kleiman to ask if he could come by that evening mr van daan left and went to get mi ep miep arrived and promised to return later that night taking with her a bag ful l of shoes dresses jackets underwear and stockings after that it was quiet in our apartment none of us felt like eating it was still hot and everything was very st range we had rented our big upstairs room to a mr goldschmidt a div orced man in his thirties who apparently had nothing to do that evening sin ce despite all our polite hints he hung around until ten oclock miep and jan gies came at eleven miep whos worked for fathe rs company since 1933 has become a close friend and so has her husband jan on ce again shoes stockings books and underwear disappeared into mieps bag and jans deep pockets at eleventhirty they too disappeared i was exhausted and even though i knew itd be my last night in my own bed i fell asleep right away and didnt wake up until mother called me at fivethirty the next morning fortunately it wasnt as hot as sunday a warm rain fell throughout the day the four of us were wrapped in so many layers of clothes it look ed as if we were going off to spend the night in a refrigerator and all that ju st so we could take more clothes with us no jew in our situation would dare leave the h ouse with a suitcase full of clothes i was wearing two undershirts three pairs o f underpants a dress and over that a skirt a jacket a raincoat two pairs of stocking s heavy shoes a cap a scarf and lots more i was suffocating even before we left the house but no one bothered to ask me how i felt margot stuffed her schoolbag with schoolbooks went to get h er bicycle and with miep leading the way rode off into the great unknown at any rate thats how i thought of it since i still didnt know where our hiding place was at seventhirty we too closed the door behind us moortje my cat was the only living creature i said goodbye to according to a note we lef t for mr goldschmidt she was to be taken to the neighbors who would give her a good h ome the stripped beds the breakfast things on the table the pou nd of meat for the cat in the kitchen all of these created the impression that wed l eft in a hurry but we werent interested in impressions we just wanted to get out of there to get away and reach our destination in safety nothing else mattered more tomorrow yours anne thursday july 9 1942 dearest kitty so there we were father mother and i walking in the pouring rain each of us with a schoolbag and a shopping bag filled to the brim with the most varied assortment of items the people on their way to work at that early hour gave u s sympathetic looks you could tell by their faces that they were sorry they couldn t offer us some kind of transportation the conspicuous yellow star spoke for itse lf only when we were walking down the street did father and mothe r reveal little by little what the plan was for months wed been moving as much of our furniture and apparel out of the apartment as we could it was agreed that we d go into hiding on july 16 because of margots callup notice the plan had to b e moved up ten days which meant wed have to make do with less orderly rooms the hiding place was located in fathers office building th ats a little hard for outsiders to understand so ill explain father didnt hav e a lot of people working in his office just mr kugler mr kleiman miep and a twentyt hreeyearold typist named bep voskuijl all of whom were informed of our coming m r voskuijl beps father works in the warehouse along with two assistants n one of whom were told anything heres a description of the building the large warehouse on the ground floor is used as a workroom and storeroom and is divided into several diffe rent sections such as the stockroom and the milling room where cinnamon cloves a nd a pepper substitute are ground next to the warehouse doors is another outside door a separ ate entrance to the office just inside the office door is a second door and beyo nd that a stairway at the top of the stairs is another door with a frosted window on whi ch the word office is written in black letters this is the big front office very large very light and very full bep miep and mr kleiman work there during the day after passing through an alcove containing a safe a wardrobe and a big supply cupbo ard you come to the small dark stuffy back office this used to be shared by mr kugler and mr van daan but now mr kugler is its only occupant mr kuglers of fice can also be reached from the hallway but only through a glass door that can be ope ned from the inside but not easily from the outside if you leave mr kuglers off ice and proceed through the long narrow hallway past the coal bin and go up four steps you find yourself in the private office the showpiece of the entire building el egant mahogany furniture a linoleum floor covered with throw rugs a radio a fancy lamp everything first class next door is a spacious kitchen with a hotwater heater and tw o gas burners and beside that a bathroom thats the second floor a wooden staircase leads from the downstairs hallway to the t hird floor at the top of the stairs is a landing with doors on either side the door on the left takes you up to the spice storage area attic and loft in the front part of the house a typically dutch very steep ankletwisting flight of stairs also runs from t he front part of the house to another door opening onto the street the door to the right of the landing leads to the secret annex at the back ofthe house no one would ever suspect there were so many rooms behi nd that plain gray door theres just one small step in front of the door and the n youre inside straight ahead of you is a steep flight of stairs to the left is a narrow hallway opening onto a room that serves as the frank familys living insert map here room and bedroom next door is a smaller room the edroom and study of the two young ladies of the family ro the right of the stairs is a wind owless washroom with a link the door in the corner leads to the toilet and another o ne to margots and my room if you go up the itairs and open the door at the top your e surprised to see such a large light and spacious room in an old canalside hous e like this it contains a stove thanks to the fact hat it used to be mr kuglers labora tory and a sink this will be the kitchen and bedroom of mr and mrs van daan a s well as the general living room dining room and study for us all a tiny s ide room is to be peter van daans bedroom then just as in the front part of the buil ding theres an attic and a loft so there you are now ive introduced you to the who le of our lovely annex yours anne friday july 10 1942 dearest kitty ive probably bored you with my long descript ion of our house but i still think you should know where ive ended up how i ended up here is something youll figure out from my next letters but first let me continue my story because as you know i wa snt finished after we arrived at 263 prinsengracht miep quickly led us through th e long hallway and up the wooden staircase to the next floor and into the annex she shu t the door behind us leaving us alone margot had arrived much earlier on her bike and was waiting for us our living room and all the other rooms were so full of stuff th at i cant find the words to describe it all the cardboard boxes that had been se nt to the office in the last few months were piled on the floors and beds the small ro om was filled from floor to cethng with linens if we wanted to sleep in properly made beds that night we had to get going and straighten up the mess mother and marg ot were unable to move a muscle they lay down on their bare mattresses tired miserable and i dont know what else but father and i the two cleaneruppers in th e family started in right away all day long we unpacked boxes filled cupboards hammered n ails and straightened up the mess until we fell exhausted into our clean beds at night we hadnt eaten a hot meal all day but we didnt care mother and margot were too ti red and keyed up to eat and father and i were too busy tuesday morning we started where we left off the night before bep and miep went grocery shopping with our ration coupons father worked on o ur blackout screens we scrubbed the kitchen floor and were once again busy from sun up to sundown until wednesday i didnt have a chance to think about the enormous change in my life then for the first time since our arrival in the secret annex i found a moment to tell you all about it and to realize what had happened to me and what was yet to happen yours anne saturday july 11 1942 dearest kitty father mother and margot still cant get used to the chiming of the westertoren clock which tells us the time every quarter of an hour not me i liked it from the start it sounds so reassuring especially at night you no d oubt want to hear what i think of being in hiding well all i can say is that i dont rea lly know yet i dont think ill ever feel at home in this house but that doesnt me an i hate it its more like being on vacation in some strange pension kind of an odd way to look at life in hiding but thats how things are the annex is an ideal place to hide in it may be damp and lopsided but theres probably not a more comfortab le hiding place in all of amsterdam no in all of holland up to now our bedroom with its blank walls was very bare tha nks to father who brought my entire postcard and moviestar collection he re beforehand and to a brush and a pot of glue i was able to plaster the walls with pi ctures it looks much more cheerful when the van daans arrive well be able to bui ld cupboards and other odds and ends out of the wood piled in the attic margot and mother have recovered somewhat yesterday mothe r felt well enough to cook splitpea soup for the first time but then she was downs tairstalking and forgot all about it the beans were scorched black and no amount of s craping could get them out of the pan last night the four of us went down to the private office and li stened to england on the radio i was so scared someone might hear it that i literal ly begged father to take me back upstairs mother understood my anxiety and went with me whatever we do were very afraid the neighbors might hear or see us we start ed off immediately the first day sewing curtains actually you can hardly call the m that since theyre nothing but scraps of fabric varying greatly in shape quality and p attern which father and i stitched crookedly together with unskilled fingers these works of art were tacked to the windows where theyll stay until we come out of hiding the building on our right is a branch of the keg company a firm from zaandam and on the left is a furniture workshop though the people who wor k there are not on the premises after hours any sound we make might travel through the walls weve forbidden margot to cough at night even though she has a bad c old and are giving her large doses of codeine im looking forward to the arrival of the van daans which is s et for tuesday it will be much more fun and also not as quiet you see its the silenc e that makes me so nervous during the evenings and nights and id give anythin g to have one of our helpers sleep here its really not that bad here since we can do our own cooking a nd can listen to the radio in daddys office mr kleiman and miep and bep voskuijl too have helped us so m uch weve already canned loads of rhubarb strawberries and cherries so for t he time being i doubt well be bored we also have a supply of reading material and were going to buy lots of games of course we cant ever look out the window or go outsi de and we have to be quiet so the people downstairs cant hear us yesterday we had our hands full we had to pit two crates of che rries for mr kugler to can were going to use the empty crates to make bookshelve s someones calling me yours anne comment added by anne on september 2g 1942 not beina able to ao outside upsets me more than i can say and im terrified our hi dina place will be discovered and that well be shot that of course is a fairl y dismal prospect sunday july 12 1942 theyve all been so nice to me this last month because of my bir thday and yet every day i feel myself drifting further away from mother and margo t i worked hard today and they praised me only to start picking on me again five min utes later you can easily see the difference between the way they deal wi th margot and the way they deal with me for example margot broke the vacuum clean er and because of that weve been without light for the rest of the day mother s aid well margot its easy to see youre not used to working otherwise youd have known better than to yank the plug out by the cord margot made some reply and tha t was the end of the story but this afternoon when i wanted to rewrite something on mot hers shopping list because her handwriting is so hard to read she wouldnt let m e she bawled me out again and the whole family wound up getting involved i dont fit in with them and ive felt that clearly in the last few weeks theyre so sentimental together but id rather be sentimental on my ow n theyre always saying how nice it is with the four of us and that we get along so well without giving a moments thought to the fact that i dont feel that way daddys the only one who understands me now and again thoug h he usually sides with mother and margot another thing i cant stand is having them talk about me in front of outsiders telling them how i cried or how sensibly i m behaving its horrible and sometimes they talk about moortje and i cant take that at all moortje is my weak spot i miss her every minute of the day and no one knows h ow often i think of her whenever i do my eyes fill with tears moortje is so sw eet and i love her so much that i keep dreaming shell come back to us i have plenty of dreams but the reality is that well have to s tay here until the war is over we cant ever go outside and the only visitors we can have are miep her husband jan bep voskuijl mr voskuijl mr kugler mr kle iman and mrs kleiman though she hasnt come because she thinks its too dangerous comment added by anne in september 1942 daddys always so ni ce he understands me perfectly and i wish we could have a heartto heart talk sometime without my bursting instantly into tears but apparently th at has to do with my age id like to spend all my time writing but that would probably get boring up to now ive only confided my thoughts to my diary i still ha vent gotten around to writing amusing sketches that i could read aloud at a later da te in the future im going to devote less time to sentimentality and more time to r eality friday august 14 1942 dear kitty ive deserted you for an entire month but so little has happe ned that i cant find a newsworthy item to relate every single day the van daans arr ived on july 13 we thought they were coming on the fourteenth but from the thir teenth to sixteenth the germans were sending out callup notices right and left and c ausing a lot of unrest so they decided it would be safer to leave a day too early than a day too late peter van daan arrived at ninethirty in the morning while w e were still at breakfast peters going on sixteen a shy awkward boy who se company wont amount to much mr and mrs van daan came half an hour later much to our amusement mrs van daan was carrying a hatbox wit h a large chamber pot inside i just dont feel at home without my chamber pot she exclaimed and it was the first item to find a permanent place under the divan i nstead of a chamber pot mr van d was lugging a collapsible tea table under his a rm from the first we ate our meals together and after three day s it felt as if the seven of us had become one big family naturally the van daans had m uch to tell about the week wed been away from civilization we were especially in terested in what had happened to our apartment and to mr goldschmidt mr van daan filled us in monday morning at nine mr goldsc hmidt phoned and asked if i could come over i went straightaway and found a ver y distraught mr goldschmidt he showed me a note that the frank family had lef t behind as instructed he was planning to bring the cat to the neighbors which i agreed was a good idea he was afraid the house was going to be searched so we wnt through all the rooms straightening up here and there and clearing the b reakfast things off the table suddenly i saw a notepad on mrs franks desk with an a ddress in maastricht written on it even though i knew mrs frank had left it on purp ose i pretended to be surprised and horrified and begged mr goldschmidt to bur n this incriminating piece of paper i swore up and down that i knew nothing about your dis appearance but that the note had given me an idea mr goldschmidt i said i be t i know what this address refers to about six months ago a highranking offic er came to the office it seems he and mr frank grew up together he promised to help mr frank if it was ever necessary as i recall he was stationed in maastricht i think this officer has kept his word and is somehow planning to help them cross over t o belgium and then to switzerland theres no harm in telling this to any friend s of the franks who come asking about them of course you dont need to mention the pa rt about maastricht and after that i left this is the story most of your friends ha ve been told because i heard it later from several other people we thought it was extremely funny but we laughed even harder when mr van daan told us that certain people have vivid imaginations for exa mple one family living on our square claimed they sawall four of us riding by on our bike s early in the morning and another woman was absolutely positive wed been loaded i nto some kind of military vehicle in the middle of the night yours anne friday august 21 1942 dear kitty now our secret annex has truly become secret because so many houses are being searched for hidden bicycle s mr kugler thought it would be better to have a bookcase built in front of the entran ce to our hiding place it swings out on its hinges and opens like a door mr voskuijl did the carpentry work mr voskuijl has been told that the seven of us are in hiding and hes been most helpful now whenever we want to go downstairs we have to duck and then j ump after the first three days we were all walking around with bumps on our f oreheads from banging our heads against the low doorway then peter cushioned it by nailing a towel stuffed with wood shavings to the doorframe lets see if it helps im not doing much schoolwork ive given myself a vacation u ntil september father wants to start tutoring me then but we have to buy all the book s first theres little change in our lives here peters hair was was hed today but thats nothing special mr van daan and i are always at loggerheads with each other mama always treats me like a baby which i cant stand for the rest things are going better i dont think peters gotten any nicer hes an obnox ious boy who lies around on his bed all day only rousing himself to do a little carpent ry work before returning to his nap what a dope mama gave me another one of her dreadful sermons this morning we take the opposite view of everything daddys a sweetheart he may ge t mad at me but it never lasts longer than five minutes its a beautiful day outside nice and hot and in spite of eve rything we make the most of the weather by lounging on the folding bed in the attic yours anne comment added by anne on september 21 1942 mr van daan has b een as nice as pie to me recently ive said nothina but have been en joyina it while it lasts wednesday september 2 1942 dearest kitty mr and mrs van daan have had a terrible fight ive never see n anything like it since mother and father wouldnt dream of shouting at each other li ke that the argument was based on something so trivial it didnt seem worth wastin g a single word on it oh well to each his own of course its very difficult for peter who gets caught in t he middle but no one takes peter seriously anymore since hes hypersensitive a nd lazy yesterday he was beside himself with worry because his tongue was blue instea d of pink this rare phenomenon disappeared as quickly as it came today hes wal king around with a heavy scarf on because hes got a stiff neck his highness has been complaining of lumbago too aches and pains in his heart kidneys and lungs a re also par for the course hes an absolute hypochondriac thats the right w ord isnt it mother and mrs van daan arent getting along very well ther e are enough reasons for the friction to give you one small example mrs van d ha s removed all but three of her sheets from our communal linen closet shes ass uming that mothers can be used for both families shell be in for a nasty surprise wh en she discovers that mother has followed her lead furthermore mrs van d is ticked off because were using he r china instead of ours shes still trying to find out what weve done with our plates theyre a lot closer than she thinks since theyre packed in cardboard boxes in the at tic behind a load of opekta advertising material as long as were in hiding the plates will remain out of her reach since im always having accidents its just as we ll yesterday i broke one of mrs van ds soup bowls oh she angrily exclaimed cant you be more careful tha t was my last one please bear in mind kitty that the two ladies speak abomina ble dutch i dont dare comment on the gentlemen theyd be highly insulted if you were to hear their bungled attempts youd laugh your head off weve given up p ointing out their errors since correcting them doesnt help anyway whenever i quote mother or mrs van daan ill write proper dutch instead of trying to duplicate their speech last week there was a brief interruption in our monotonous ro utine this was provided by peter and a book about women i should explain that margo t and peter are allowed to read nearly all the books mr kleiman lends us but the adults preferred to keep this special book to themselves this immediately piqu ed peters curiosity what forbidden fruit did it contain he snuck off with it when his m other was downstairs talking and took himself and his booty to the loft for two da ys all was well mrs van daan knew what he was up to but kept mum until mr van daan f ound out about it he threw a fit took the book away and assumed that would be the end of the business however hed neglected to take his sons curiosi ty into account peter not in the least fazed by his fathers swift action began thinki ng up ways to read the rest of this vastly interesting book in the meantime mrs van d asked mother for her opinion mot her didnt think this particular book was suitable for margot but she saw no harm i n letting her read most other books you see mrs van daan mother said theres a big difference between margot and peter to begin with margots a girl and girls are always mo re mature than boys second shes already read many serious books and doesnt go looking for those which are no longer forbidden third margots much more sensible and intellectually advanced as a result of her four years at an excellent school mrs van daan agreed with her but felt it was wrong as a matter of principle to let youngsters read books written for adults meanwhile peter had thought of a suitable time when no one wo uld be interested in either him or the book at seventhirty in the evening when t he entire family was listening to the radio in the private office he took his trea sure and stole off to the loft again he should have been back by eightthirty but he w as so engrossed in the book that he forgot the time and was just coming down the stair s when his father entered the room the scene that followed was not surprising after a slap a whack and a tugofwar the book lay on the table and peter was in the loft this is how matters stood when it was time for the family to eat peter stayed upstairs no one gave him a moments thought hed have to go t o bed without his dinner we continued eating chatting merrily away when su ddenly we heard a piercing whistle we lay down our forks and stared at each other the sh ock clearly visible on our pale faces then we heard peters voice through the chimney i won t come down mr van daan leapt up his napkin falling to the floor and sho uted with the blood rushing to his face ive had enough father afraid of what might happen grabbed him by the arm an d the two men went to the attic after much struggling and kicking peter wound up in his room with the door shut and we went on eating mrs van daan wanted to save a piece of bread for her darling so n but mr van d was adamant if he doesnt apologize this minute hell hav e to sleep in the loft we protested that going without dinner was enough punishmen t what if peter were to catch cold we wouldnt be able to call a doctor peter didnt apologize and returned to the loft mr van daan decided to leave well enough alone though he did note the next morning that peters bed had been slept in at seven peter went to the a ttic again but was persuaded to come downstairs when father spoke a few friendl y words to him after three days of sullen looks and stubborn silence everything was back to normal yours anne monday september 21 1942 dearest kitty today ill tell you the general news here in the annex a lamp h as been mounted above my divan bed so that in the future when i hear the guns go ing off ill be able to pull a cord and switch on the light i cant use it at the mome nt because were keeping our window open a little day and night the male members of the van daan contingent have built a very h andy woodstained food safe with real screens up to now this glorious cupboar d has been located in peters room but in the interests of fresh air its been move d to the attic where it once stood theres now a shelf i advised peter to put his tab le underneath the shelf add a nice rug and hang his own cupboard where the table now sta nds that might make his little cubbyhole more comfy though i certainly wou ldnt like to sleep there mrs van daan is unbearable im continually being scolded f or my incessant chatter when im upstairs i simply let the words bounce right off me madame now has a new trick up her sleeve trying to get out of washing the pots a nd pans if theres a bit of food left at the bottom of the pan she leaves it to spoil instead of transferring it to a glass dish then in the afternoon when margot is stuck w ith cleaning all the pots and pans madame exclaims oh poor margot you have so much work to do every other week mr kleiman brings me a couple of books writt en for girls my age im enthusiastic about the loop ter heul series ive enjoye d all of cissy van marxveldts books very much ive read the zaniest summer fo ur times and the ludicrous situations still make me laugh father and i are currently working on our family tree and he t ells me something about each person as we go along ive begun my schoolwork i m working hard at french cramming five irregular verbs into my head every day but ive forgotten much too much of what i learned in school peter has taken up his english with great reluctance a few sc hoolbooks have just arrived and i brought a large supply of notebooks pencils erasers and labels from home pim thats our pet name for father wants me to help him with his dutch lessons im perfectly willing to tutor him in exchange for h is assistance with french and other subjects but he makes the most unbelievable mista kes i sometimes listen to the dutch broadcasts from london prin ce bernhard recently announced that princess juliana is expecting a baby in janua ry which i think is wonderful no one here understands why i take such an interes t in the royal family a few nights ago i was the topic of discussion and we all decid ed i was an ignoramus as a result i threw myself into my schoolwork the next day since i have little desire to still be a freshman when im fourteen or fift een the fact that im hardly allowed to read anything was also discussed at the mo ment mothers reading gentlemen wives and servants and of course im not allowed to read it though margot is first i have to be more intellectually develope d like my genius of a sister then we discussed my ignorance of philosophy psych ology and physiology i immediately looked up these big words in the dictionary i ts true i dont know anything about these subjects but maybe ill be smarter nex t year ive come to the shocking conclusion that i have only one long sleeved dress and three cardigans to wear in the winter fathers given me perm ission to knit a white wool sweater the yarn isnt very pretty but itll be warm a nd thats what counts some of our clothing was left with friends but unfortunatel y we wont be able to get to it until after the war provided its still there of cours e id just finished writing something about mrs van daan when she walked into the room thump i slammed the book shut hey anne cant i even take a peek no mrs van daan just the last page then no not even the last page mrs van daan of course i nearly died since that particular page contain ed a rather unflattering description of her theres something happening every day but im too tired and lazy to write it all down yours anne friday september 25 1942 dearest kitty father has a friend a man in his midseventies named mr dreh er whos sick poor and deaf as a post at his side like a useless appendage is hi s wife twentyseven years younger and equally poor whose arms and legs are loade d with real and fake bracelets and rings left over from more prosperous days thi s mr dreher has already been a great nuisance to father and ive always admired the s aintly patience with which he handled this pathetic old man on the phone when we we re still living at home mother used to advise him to put a gramophone in front of the receiver one that would repeat every three minutes yes mr dreher and no mr dreher since the old man never understood a word of fathers lengthy repli es anyway today mr dreher phoned the office and asked mr kugler to com e and see him mr kugler wasnt in the mood and said he would send miep but miep canceled the appointment mrs dreher called the office three times but since miep was reportedly out the entire afternoon she had to imitate beps voice dow nstairs in the office as well as upstairs in the annex there was great hilarity now e ach time the phone rings bep says thats mrs dreher and miep has to laugh so that the people on the other end of the line are greeted with an impolite giggle cant you just picture it this has got to be the greatest office in the whole wide world the bosses and the office girls have such fun together some evenings i go to the van daans for a little chat we eat mo thball cookies molasses cookies that were stored in a closet that was mothp roofed and have a good time recently the conversation was about peter i said that he often pats me on the cheek which i dont like they asked me in a typically grown up way whether i could ever learn to love peter like a brother since he loves m e like a sister oh no i said but what i was thinking was oh ugh just imagi ne i added that peters a bit stiff perhaps because hes shy boys who arent used to being around girls are like that i must say that the annex committee the mens section is ver y creative listen to the scheme theyve come up with to get a message to mr broks a n opekta co sales representative and friend whos surreptitiously hidden so me of our things for us theyre going to type a letter to a store owner in southern zea land who is indirectly one of opekta s customers and ask him to fill out a form and sen d it back in the enclosed selfaddressed envelope father will write the ad dress on the envelope himself once the letter is returned from zealand the form c an be removed and a handwritten message confirming that father is alive can be i nserted in the envelope this way mr broks can read the letter without suspecting a ru se they chose the province of zealand because its close to belgium a letter c an easily be smuggled across the border and because no one is allowed to travel the re without a special permit an ordinary salesman like mr broks would never be gr anted a permit yesterday father put on another act groggy with sleep he st umbled off to bed his feet were cold so i lent him my bed socks five minutes later h e flung them to the floor then he pulled the blankets over his head because the l ight bothered him the lamp was switched off and he gingerly poked his head out from under the covers it was all very amusing we started talking about the fact that p eter says margot is a buttinsky suddenly daddys voice was heard from the dept hs sits on her butt you mean mouschi the cat is becoming nicer to me as time goes by but i m still somewhat afraid of her yours anne sunday september 27 1942 dearest kitty mother and i had a socalled discussion today but the anno ying part is that i burst into tears i cant help it daddy is always nice to me and he a lso understands me much better at moments like these i cant stand mother its obvious that im a stranger to her she doesnt even know what i think about the m ost ordinary things we were talking about maids and the fact that youre supposed to refer to them as domestic help these days she claimed that when the war is o ver thats what theyll want to be called i didnt quite see it that way then she adde d that i talk about later so often and that i act as if i were such a lady even tho ugh im not but i dont think building sand castles in the air is such a terribl e thing to do as long as you dont take it too seriously at any rate daddy usually co mes to my defense without him i wouldnt be able to stick it out here i dont get along with margot very well either even though ou r family never has the same kind of outbursts they have upstairs i find it far from p leasant margots and mothers personalities are so alien to me i understand my gi rlfriends better than my own mother isnt that a shame for the umpteenth time mrs van daan is sulking shes very m oody and has been removing more and more of her belongings and locking them up its too bad mother doesnt repay every van daan disappearing act with a frank disappearing act some people like the van daans seem to take special delight not only in raising their own children but in helping others raise theirs margot does nt need it since shes naturally good kind and clever perfection itself but i se em to have enough mischief for the two of us more than once the air has been filled with th e van daans admonitions and my saucy replies father and mother always d efend me fiercely without them i wouldnt be able to jump back into the fray with my usual composure they keep telling me i should talk less mind my own business a nd be more modest but i seem doomed to failure if father werent so patient i d have long ago given up hope of ever meeting my parents quite moderate expectation s if i take a small helping of a vegetable i loathe and eat potato es instead the van daans especially mrs van daan cant get over how spoiled i am come on anne eat some more vegetables she says no thank you maam i reply the potatoes are more than e nough vegetables are good for you your mother says so too have so me more she insists until father intervenes and upholds my right to refuse a dish i dont like then mrs van d really flies off the handle you should have been at our house where children were brought up the way they should be i dont call this a proper upbringing anne is terribly spoiled id never allow that if anne were my daughter this is always how her tirades begin and end if anne were my d aughter thank goodness im not but to get back to the subject of raising children yesterday a silence fell after mrs van d finished her little speech father then replied i th ink anne is very well brought up at least shes learned not to respond to your inte rminable sermons as far as the vegetables are concerned all i have to say is look who s calling the kettle black mrs van d was soundly defeated the pot calling the ketde bl ack refers of course to madame herself since she cant tolerate beans or any kind of cabbage in the evening because they give her gas but i could say the same what a do pe dont you think in any case lets hope she stops talking about me its so funny to see how quickly mrs van daan flushes i dont and it secredy annoys her no end yours anne monday september 281942 dearest kitty i had to stop yesterday though i was nowhere near finished i m dying to tell you about another one of our clashes but before i do id like to sa y this i think its odd that grownups quarrel so easily and so often and about such p etty matters up to now i always thought bickering was just something children d id and that they outgrew it often of course theres sometimes a reason to have a rea l quarrel but the verbal exchanges that take place here are just plain bickering i sh ould be used to the fact that these squabbles are daily occurrences but im not and n ever will be as long as im the subject of nearly every discussion they refer to th ese as discussions instead of quarrels but germans dont know the differenc e they criticize everything and i mean everything about me my behavior my personality my manners every inch of me from head to toe and back again is t he subject of gossip and debate harsh words and shouts are constantly being flun g at my head though im absolutely not used to it according to the powers that be i m supposed to grin and bear it but i cant i have no intention of taking their insul ts lying down ill show them that anne frank wasnt born yesterday theyll sit up an d take notice and keep their big mouths shut when i make them see they ought to attend to their own manners instead of mine how dare they act that way its simp ly barbaric ive been astonished time and again at such rudeness and most of all at such stupidity mrs van daan but as soon as ive gotten used to the idea an d that shouldnt take long ill give them a taste of their own medicine and then th eyll change their tune am i really as badmannered headstrong stubborn pushy s tupid lazy etc etc as the van daans say i am no of course not i know i have my faults and shortcomings but they blow them all out of proportion if yo u only knew kitty how i seethe when they scold and mock me it wont take long before i explode with pentup rage but enough of that ive bored you long enough with my quarrel s and yet i cant resist adding a highly interesting dinner conversation somehow we landed on the subject of pims extreme diffidence his modesty is a wellknown fact which even the stupidest person wouldnt d ream of questioning all of a sudden mrs van daan who feels the need to bring herself i nto every conversation remarked im very modest and retiring too much more so than my husband have you ever heard anything so ridiculous this sentence cl early illustrates that shes not exactly what youd call modest mr van daan who felt obliged to explain the much more so tha n my husband answered calmly i have no desire to be modest and retiring in my experience you get a lot further by being pushy and turning to me he added dont be modest and retiring anne it will get you nowhere mother agreed completely with this viewpoint but as usual mrs van daan had to add her two cents this time however instead of addressing me d irectly she turned to my parents and said you must have a strange outlook on life t o be able to say that to anne things were different when i was growing up though t hey probably havent changed much since then except in your modern household this was a direct hit at mothers modern childrearing metho ds which shes defended on many occasions mrs van daan was so upset her face turned b right red people who flush easily become even more agitated when they feel the mselves getting hot under the collar and they quickly lose to their opponents the nonflushed mother who now wanted to have the matter over and done with as quickly as possible paused for a moment to think before she r eplied well mrs van daan i agree that its much better if a person isnt overmode st my husband margot and peter are all exceptionally modest your husband anne a nd i though not exactly the opposite dont let ourselves be pushed around mrs van daan oh but mrs frank i dont understand what yo u mean honestly im extremely modest and retiring how can you say that im pushy mother i didnt say you were pushy but no one would describ e you as having a retiring disposition mrs van d id like to know in what way im pushy if i didnt look out for myself here no one else would and id soon starve but that doesnt mean im not as modest and retiring as your husband mother had no choice but to laugh at this ridiculous selfdef ense which irritated mrs van daan not exactly a born debater she continued her magni ficent account in a mixture of german and dutch until she got so tangled up in her own words that she finally rose from her chair and was just about to leave the roo m when her eye fell on me you should have seen her as luck would have it the moment mrs van d turned around i was shaking my head in a combination of compassion an d irony i wasnt doing it on purpose but id followed her tirade so intently t hat my reaction was completely involuntary mrs van d wheeled around and gave me a tonguelashing hard germanic mean and vulgar exactly like some fat red faced fishwife it was a joy to behold if i could draw id like to have sketched her as she was then she struck me as so comical that silly little scatterbrain iv e learned one thing you only really get to know a person after a fight only then can you jud ge their true character yours anne tuesday september 29 1942 dearest kitty the strangest things happen to you when youre in hiding try to picture this because we dont have a bathtub we wash ourselves in a washtu b and because theres only hot water in the office by which i mean the entir e lower floor the seven of us take turns making the most of this great opportuni ty but since none of us are alike and are all plagued by varying degrees of modesty each member of the family has selected a different place to wash peter takes a b ath in the office kitchen even though it has a glass door when its time for his bath he goes around to each of us in turn and announces that we shouldnt walk past the kit chen for the next half hour he considers this measure to be sufficient mr van d t akes his bath upstairs figuring that the safety of his own room outweighs the diffic ulty of having to carry the hot water up all those stairs mrs van d has yet to take a b ath shes waiting to see which is the best place father bathes in the private offi ce and mother in the kitchen behind a fire screen while margot and i have declare d the front office to be our bathing grounds since the curtains are drawn on saturda y afternoon we scrub ourselves in the dark while the one who isnt in the bath look s out the window through a chink in the curtains and gazes in wonder at the endl essly amusing people a week ago i decided i didnt like this spot and have been on the lookout for more comfortable bathing quarters it was peter who gave me the id ea of setting my washtub in the spacious office bathroom i can sit down turn on the light lock the door pour out the water without anyones help and all witho ut the fear of being seen i used my lovely bathroom for the first time on sunday and str ange as it may seem i like it better than any other place the plumber was at work downstairs on wednesday moving the w ater pipes and drains from the office bathroom to the hallway so the pipes wo nt freeze during a cold winter the plumbers visit was far from pleasant not only w ere we not allowed to run water during the day but the bathroom was also offlimit s ill tell you how we handled this problem you may find it unseemly of me to bring i t up but im not so prudish about matters of this kind on the day of our arrival father and i improvised a chamber pot sacrificing a canning jar for this purpose fo r the duration of the plumbers visit canning jars were put into service during t he daytime to hold our calls of nature as far as i was concerned this wasnt half as diffi cult as having to sit still all day and not say a word you can imagine how hard that was for miss quack quack quack on ordinary days we have to speak in a whisper n ot being able to talk or move at all is ten times worse after three days of constant sitting my backside was stiff a nd sore nightly calisthenics helped yours anne thursday october 1 1942 dear kitty yesterday i had a horrible fright at eight oclock the doorb ell suddenly rang all i could think of was that someone was coming to get us you know w ho i mean but i calmed down when everybody swore it must have been either pra nksters or the mailman the days here are very quiet mr levinsohn a little jewish p harmacist and chemist is working for mr kugler in the kitchen since hes familiar with the entire building were in constant dread that hell take it into his head to go h ave a look at what used to be the laboratory were as still as baby mice who would ha ve guessed three months ago that quicksilver anne would have to sit so quietly for hours on end and whats more that she could mrs van daans birthday was the twentyninth though we did nt have a large celebration she was showered with flowers simple gifts an d good food apparently the red carnations from her spouse are a family tradition let me pause a moment on the subject of mrs van daan and tell yo u that her attempts to flirt with father are a constant source of irrita tion to me she pats him on the cheek and head hikes up her skirt and makes socalled wit ty remarks in an effort to gets pims attention fortunately he finds her neither pretty nor charming so he doesnt respond to her flirtations as you know im quite th e jealous type and i cant abide her behavior after all mother doesnt act that way to ward mr van d which is what i told mrs van d right to her face from time to time peter can be very amusing he and i have one th ing in common we like to dress up which makes everyone laugh one evening w e made our appearance with peter in one of his mothers skintight dre sses and me in his suit he wore a hat i had a cap on the grownups split their sides la ughing and we enjoyed ourselves every bit as much bep bought new skirts for margot and me at the bijenkorf the f abric is hideous like the burlap bag potatoes come in just the kind of thing the dep artment stores wouldnt dare sell in the olden days now costing 2400 guilders marg ots and 775 guilders mine we have a nice treat in store beps ordered a correspondence course in shorthand for margot peter and me just you wait by this time next year we ll be able to take perfect shorthand in any case learning to write a secret co de like that is really interesting i have a terrible pain in my index finger on my left hand so i cant do any ironing what luck mr van daan wants me to sit next to him at the table since marg ot doesnt eat enough to suit him fine with me i like changes theres alwa ys a tiny black cat roaming around the yard and it reminds me of my dear sweet moo rtje another reason i welcome the change is that mamas always carping at m e especially at the table now margot will have to bear the brunt of it or rather wont since mother doesnt make such sarcastic remarks to her not to that parag on of virtue im always teasing margot about being a paragon of virtue these days an d she hates it maybe itll teach her not to be such a goodygoody high time she lea rned to end this hodgepodge of news a particularly amusing joke t old by mr van daan what goes click ninetynine times and clack once a centipede with a clubfoot byebye anne saturday october 3 1942 dear kitty everybody teased me quite a bit yesterday because i lay down o n the bed next to mr van daan at your age shocking and other remarks along th ose lines silly of course id never want to sleep with mr van daan the way they m ean yesterday mother and i had another runin and she really kick ed up a fuss she told daddy all my sins and i started to cry which made me cry too an d i already had such an awful headache i finally told daddy that i love him more than i do mother to which he replied that it was just a passing phase but i don t think so i simply cant stand mother and i have to force myself not to snap at he r all the time and to stay calm when id rather slap her across the face i dont kn ow why ive taken such a terrible dislike to her daddy says that if mother isnt fee ling well or has a headache i should volunteer to help her but im not going to because i dont love her and dont enjoy doing it i can imagine mother dying someday but daddys death seems inconceivable its very mean of me but thats how i fe el i hope mother will never read this or anything else ive written ive been allowed to read more grownup books lately evas y outh by nico van suchtelen is currently keeping me busy i dont think there s much of a difference between this and books for teenage girls eva thought that ch ildren grew on trees like apples and that the stork plucked them off the tree when they were ripe and brought them to the mothers but her girlfriends cat had kittens and eva saw them coming out of the cat so she thought cats laid eggs and hatched them like chickens and that mothers who wanted a child also went upstairs a few days befor e their time to lay an egg and brood on it after the babies arrived the mothers wer e pretty weak from all that squatting at some point eva wanted a baby too she took a wool scarf and spread it on the ground so the egg could fall into it and then s he squatted down and began to push she clucked as she waited but no egg came out f inally after shed been sitting for a long time something did come but it was a s ausage instead of an egg eva was embarrassed she thought she was sick funny is nt it there are also parts of evas youth that talk about women selling their bodi es on the street and asking loads of money id be mortified in front of a man like t hat in addition it mentions evas menstruation oh i long to get my period th en ill really be grown up daddy is grumbling again and threatening to take away my d iary oh horror of horrors

jewish friends and acquaintances are being taken away in droves th e gestapo is treating them very roughly and transporting them in cattle cars to wes terbork the big camp in drenthe to which theyre sending all the jews miep told us ab out someone whod managed to escape from there it must be terrible in westerbo rk the people get almost nothing to eat much less to drink as water is availab le only one hour a day and theres only one toilet and sink for several thousand peo ple men and women sleep in the same room and women and children often have their head s shaved escape is almost impossible many people look jewish and theyre bra nded by their shorn heads if its that bad in holland what must it be like in those faraw ay and uncivilized places where the germans are sending them we assume that most of the m are being murdered the english radio says theyre being gassed perh aps thats the quickest way to die i feel terrible mieps accounts of these horrors are so hear trending and miep is also very distraught the other day for instance the gestapo de posited an elderly crippled jewish woman on mieps doorstep while they set off to find a ca r the old woman was terrified of the glaring searchlights and the guns firin g at the english planes overhead yet miep didnt dare let her in nobody would the g ermans are generous enough when it comes to punishment bep is also very subdued her boyfriend is being sent to germa ny every time the planes fly over shes afraid theyre going to drop their ent ire bomb load on bertuss head jokes like oh dont worry they cant all fall on him or one bomb is all it takes are hardly appropriate in this situation bertus is n ot the only one being forced to work in germany trainloads of young men depart daily som e of them try to sneak off the train when it stops at a small station but only a few ma nage to escape unnoticed and find a place to hide but thats not the end of my lamentations have you ever heard the term hostages thats the latest punishment for saboteurs its the most ho rrible thing you can imagine leading citizens innocent people are taken pr isoner to await their execution if the gestapo cant find the saboteur they simp ly grab five hostages and line them up against the wall you read the announcements of t heir death in the paper where theyre referred to as fatal accidents fine specimens of humanity those germans and to think im a ctually one of them no thats not true hitler took away our nationality long ag o and besides there are no greater enemies on earth than the germans and the jews yours anne wednesday october 14 1942 dear kitty im terribly busy yesterday i began by translating a chapte r from la belle nivemaise and writing down vocabulary words then i worked on an awful m ath problem and translated three pages of french grammar besides today fr ench grammar and history i simply refuse to do that wretched math every day daddy thin ks its awful too im almost better at it than he is though in fact neither of us is any good so we always have to call on margots help im also working away at my shorthand which i enjoy of the three of us ive made the most progress ive read the storm family its quite good but doesnt comp are to joop ter heul anyway the same words can be found in both books which makes sense because theyre written by the same author cissy van marxveldt is a t errific writer im definitely going to let my own children read her books too moreover ive read a lot of korner plays i like the way he wri tes for example hedwig the cousin from bremen the governess the green dom ino etc mother margot and i are once again the best of buddies its a ctually a lot nicer that way last night margot and i were lying side by side in my bed i t was incredibly cramped but thats what made it fun she asked if she could re ad my diary once in a while parts of it i said and asked about hers she gave me permis sion to read her diary as well the conversation turned to the future and i asked what she wa nted to be when she was older but she wouldnt say and was quite mysterious abou t it i gathered it had something to do with teaching of course im not absolutely sure but i suspect its something along those lines i really shouldnt be so nosy this morning ilay on peters bed after first having chased him off it he was furious but i didnt care he might consider being a little more frien dly to me from time to time after all i did give him an apple last night i once asked margot if she thought i was ugly she said that i wa s cute and had nice eyes a little vague dont you think well until next time anne frank ps this morning we all took turns on the scale margot now wei ghs 132 pounds mother 136 father 155 anne 96 peter 14g mrs van daan 117 mr van daan 165 in the three months since ive been here ive gained 19 pound s a lot huh tuesday october 20 1942 dearest kitty my hands still shaking though its been two hours since we h ad the scare i should explain that there are five fire extinguishers in the buildi ng the office staff stupidly forgot to warn us that the carpenter or whatever hes called was coming to fill the extinguishers as a result we didnt bother to be quiet unti l i heard the sound of hammering on the landing across from the bookcase i immed iately assumed it was the carpenter and went to warn bep who was eating lunch that she couldnt go back downstairs father and i stationed ourselves at the door so w e could hear when the man had left after working for about fifteen minutes he lai d his hammer and some other tools on our bookcase or so we thought and banged on o ur door we turned white with fear had he heard something after all and now want ed to check out this mysteriouslooking bookcase it seemed so since he kept kn ocking pulling pushing and jerking on it i was so scared i nearly fainted at the thought of this total st ranger managing to discover our wonderful hiding place just when i thought my d ays were numbered we heard mr kleimans voice saying open up its me we open ed the door at once what had happened the hook fastening the bookcase had gotten stuck which is wh y no one had been able to warn us about the carpenter after the man had left mr kle iman came to get bep but couldnt open the bookcase i cant tell you how relieved i was in my imagination the man i thought was trying to get inside the secret annex had kept growing and growing until hed become not only a giant but also the cruele st fascist in the world whew fortunately everything worked out all right at leas t this time we had lots of fun on monday miep and jan spent the night with u s margot and i slept in father and mothers room for the night so the gieses c ould have our beds the menu was drawn up in their honor and the meal was deliciou s the festivities were briefly interrupted when fathers lamp caused a short c ircuit and we were suddenly plunged into darkness what were we to do we did hav e fuses but the fuse box was at the rear of the dark warehouse which made this a par ticularly unpleasant job at night still the men ventured forth and ten minutes l ater we were able to put away the candles i was up early this morning jan was already dressed since he had to leave at eightthirty he was upstairs eating breakfast by eight mi ep was busy getting dressed and i found her in her undershirt when i came in she w ears the same kind of long underwear i do when she bicycles margot and i threw on our clothes as well and were upstairs earlier than usual after a pleasant break fast miep headed downstairs it was pouring outside and she was glad she didn t have to bicycle to work daddy and i made the beds and afterward i learned five i rregular french verbs quite industrious dont you think margot and peter were reading in our room with mouschi curle d up beside margot on the divan after my irregular french verbs i joined them and read the woods are singingfor all eternity its quite a beautiful book but ve ry unusual im almost finished next week its beps turn to spend the night yours anne thursday october 29 1942 my dearest kitty im very worried fathers sick hes covered with spots and has a high temperature it looks like measles just think we cant even call a doctor mother is making him perspire in hopes of sweating out the fever this morning miep told us that the furniture has been removed from the van daans apartment on zuideramstellaan we havent told mrs van d yet shes been so nervenmassig nervous lately and we dont feel like h earing her moan and groan again about all the beautiful china and lovely chairs she had to leave behind we had to abandon most of our nice things too whats the good of grum bling about it now father wants me to start reading books by hebbel and other wel lknown german writers i can read german fairly well by now except that i us ually mumble the words instead of reading them silently to myself but thatl l pass father has taken the plays of goethe and schiller down from the big bookcase and is planning to read to me every evening weve started off with don carlos encoura ged by fathers good example mother pressed her prayer book into my hands i read a few prayers in german just to be polite they certainly sound beautiful b ut they mean very little to me why is she making me act so religious and devout tomorrow were going to light the stove for the first time th e chimney hasnt been swept in ages so the room is bound to fill with smoke lets ho pe the thing draws yours anne monday november 2 1942 dear kitty bep stayed with us friday evening it was fun but she didnt s leep very well because shed drunk some wine for the rest theres nothing special to report i had an awful headache yesterday and went to bed early margots being exa sperating again this morning i began sorting out an index card file from the of fice because itd fallen over and gotten all mixed up before long i was going nuts i as ked margot and peter to help but they were too lazy so i put it away im not crazy enough to do it all by myself anne frank ps i forgot to mention the important news that im probably g oing to get my period soon i can tell because i keep finding a whitish smear in my pa nties and mother predicted it would start soon i can hardly wait its such a m omentous event too bad i cant use sanitary napkins but you cant get them anymore and mamas tampons can be used only by women whove had a baby i comment added by anne on january 22 1944 i wouldnt be able t o write that kind of thing anymore now that im rereading my diary after a year and a half im sur prised at my childish innocence deep down i know i could never be that innocent aga in however much id like to be i can understand the mood chanaes and the comments about margot mother and father as if id written them only yesterday but i cant imagine writina so openly about other matters it embarrasses me areatly to rea d the panes dealina with subjects that i remembered as beina nicer than they actually were my descriptions are so indelicate but enouah of that i can also understand my homesickness and yearning for moort je the whole time ive been here ive longed unconsciously and at times consciousl y for trust love and physical affection this longing may change in intensity b ut its always there thursday november 5 1942 dear kitty the british have finally scored a few successes in africa and stalingrad hasnt fallen yet so the men are happy and we had coffee and tea this morning for the rest nothing special to report this week ive been reading a lot and doing little work that s the way things ought to be thats surely the road to success mother and i are getting along better lately but were never close fathers not very open about his feelings but hes the same sweetheart hes al ways been we lit the stove a few days ago and the entire room is still filled with sm oke i prefer central heating and im probably not the only one margots a stinke r theres no other word for it a constant source of irritation morning noon and n ight anne frank saturday november 7 1942 dearest kitty mothers nerves are very much on edge and that doesnt bode w ell for me is it just a coincidence that father and mother never scold margot and a lways blame me for everything last night for example margot was reading a bo ok with beautiful illustrations she got up and put the book aside for later i w asnt doing anything so i picked it up and began looking at the pictures margot carne b ack saw her book in my hands knitted her brow and angrily demanded the book back i wanted to look through it some more margot got madder by the minute and mot her butted in margot was reading that book give it back to her father came in and without even knowing what was going on sa w that margot was being wronged and lashed out at me id like to see what youd do if margot was looking at one of your books i promptly gave in put the book down and according to them l eft the room in a huff i was neither huffy nor cross but merely sad it wasnt right of father to pass judgment without knowing wh at the issue was i would have given the book to margot myself and a lot sooner i f father and mother hadnt intervened and rushed to take margots part as if she were suffering some great injustice of course mother took margots side they always take each o thers sides im so used to it that ive become completely indifferent to mother s rebukes and margots moodiness i love them but only because theyre mother and m argot i dont give a darn about them as people as far as im concerned they can go jump in a lake its different with father when i see him being partial to margot approving margots every action praising her hugging her i feel a gnawing ach e inside because im crazy about him i model myself after father and theres no one in t he world i love more he doesnt realize that he treats margot differently than he does me margot just happens to be the smartest the kindest the prettiest and th e best but i have a right to be taken seriously too ive always been the clown and misc hief maker of the family ive always had to pay double for my sins once with sc oldings and then again with my own sense of despair im no longer satisfied with the meaningless affection or the supposedly serious talks i long for something from fa ther that hes incapable of giving im not jealous of margot i never have been im no t envious of her brains or her beauty its just that id like to feel that father real ly loves me not because im his child but because im me anne i cling to father because my contempt of mother is growing dai ly and its only through him that im able to retain the last ounce of family fe eling i have left he doesnt understand that i sometimes need to vent my feelings for mother he doesnt want to talk about it and he avoids any discussion involving mothers failings and yet mother with all her shortcomings is tougher for me to deal w ith i dont know how i should act i cant very well confront her with her carelessn ess her sarcasm and her hardheartedness yet i cant continue to take the blame for everything im the opposite of mother so of course we clash i dont mean to judge her i dont have that right im simply looking at her as a mother shes n ot a mother to me i have to mother myself ive cut myself adrift from them im charting my own course and well see where it leads me i have no choice beca use i can picture what a mother and a wife should be and cant seem to find anything of the sort in the woman im supposed to call mother i tell myself time and again to overlook mothers bad example i only want to see her good points and to look inside myself for whats lacking in h er but it doesnt work and the worst part is that father and mother dont realize the ir own inadequacies and how much i blame them for letting me down are there any parent s who can make their children completely happy sometimes i think god is trying to test me both now and in the f uture ill have to become a good person on my own without anyone to serve as a mod el or advise me but itll make me stronger in the end who else but me is ever going to read these letters who else bu t me can i turn to for comfort im frequently in need of consolation i often f eel weak and more often than not i fail to meet expectations i know this and every d ay i resolve to do better they arent consistent in their treatment of me one day they say that annes a sensible girl and entitled to know everything and the next t hat annes a silly goose who doesnt know a thing and yet imagines shes learned all sh e needs to know from books im no longer the baby and spoiled little darling whos e every deed can be laughed at i have my own ideas plans and ideals but am unabl e to articulate them yet oh well so much comes into my head at night when im alone or d uring the day when im obliged to put up with people i cant abide or who inva riably misinterpret my intentions thats why i always wind up coming back to my diar y i start there and end there because kittys always patient i promise her t hat despite everything ill keep going that ill find my own way and choke back my tea rs i only wish i could see some results or just once receive encouragement from someone who loves me dont condemn me but think of me as a person who sometimes rea ches the bursting point yours anne monday november 91942 dearest kitty yesterday was peters birthday his sixteenth i was upstai rs by eight and peter and i looked at his presents he received a game of monopoly a razo r and a cigarette lighter not that he smokes so much not at all it just looks s o distinguished the biggest surprise came from mr van daan who reported at o ne that the english had landed in tunis algiers casablanca and oran this is the beginning of the end everyone was saying but c hurchill the british prime minister who must have heard the same thing being repe ated in england declared this is not the end it is not even the beginning of the end but it is perhaps the end of the beginning do you see the difference however theres reason for optimism stalingrad the russian city that has b een under attack for three months still hasnt fallen into german hands in the true spirit of the annex i should talk to you about food i should explain that theyre real gluttons up on the top floor bread is delivered daily by a very nice baker a friend of mr k leimans of course we dont have as much as we did at home but its enough we also purchase ration books on the black market the price keeps going up its alre ady risen from 27 to 33 guilders and that for mere sheets of printed paper to provide ourselves with a source of nutrition that will kee p aside from the hundred cans of food weve stored here we bought three hundred pound s of beans not just for us but for the office staff as well wed hung the sacks of beans on hooks in the hallway just inside our secret entrance but a few seams spl it under the weight so we decided to move them to the attic and peter was entrusted w ith the heavy lifting he managed to get five of the six sacks upstairs intact and was busy with the last one when the sack broke and a flood or rather a hailstorm of b rown beans went flying through the air and down the stairs since there were a bout fifty pounds of beans in that sack it made enough noise to raise the dead dow nstairs they were sure the house was falling down around their heads peter was stun ned but then burst into peals of laughter when he saw me standing at the bottom of the s tairs like an island in a sea of brown with waves of beans lapping at my ankles we p romptly began picking them up but beans are so small and slippery that they roll into every conceivable corner and hole now each time we go upstairs we bend over and hunt around so we can present mrs van daan with a handful of beans i almost forgot to mention that father has recovered from his illness yours anne ps the radio has just announced that algiers has fallen mo rocco casablanca and oran have been in english hands for several days were now wa iting for tunis tuesday november 10 1942 dearest kitty great news were planning to take an eighth person into hidi ng with us yes really we always thought there was enough room and food for one more person but we were afraid of placing an even greater burden on mr kug ler and mr kleiman but since reports of the dreadful things being done to the jew s are getting worse by the day father decided to sound out these two gentlemen and they thought it was an excellent plan its just as dangerous whether there are s even or eight they noted rightly once this was settled we sat down and mentally went through our circle of acquaintances trying to come up with a single person who wou ld blend in well with our extended family this wasnt difficult after father ha d rejected all the van daan relatives we chose a dentist named alfred dussel he lives w ith a charming christian lady whos quite a bit younger than he is theyre probably no t married but thats beside the point hes known to be quiet and refined and he se emed from our superficial acquaintance with him to be nice miep knows hi m as well so shell be able to make the necessary arrangements if he comes mr dus sel will have to sleep in my room instead of margot who will have to make do with the f olding bed after dussel arrived margot slept in her parents bedroo m well ask him to bring along something to fill cavities with yours anne thursday november 12 1942 dearest kitty miep came to tell us that shed been to see dr dussel he asked her the moment she entered the room if she knew of a hiding place and was enormous ly pleased when miep said she had something in mind she added that hed need to go into hiding as soon as possible preferably saturday but he thought this w as highly improbable since he wanted to bring his records up to date settle his accounts and attend to a couple of patients miep relayed the message to us this morning we d idnt think it was wise to wait so long all these preparations require explanation s to various people who we feel ought to be kept in the dark miep went to ask if dr dussel couldnt manage to come on saturday after all but he said no and now hes schedu led to arrive on monday i think its odd that he doesnt jump at our proposal if they p ick him up on the street it wont help either his records or his patients so w hy the delay if you ask me its stupid of father to humor him otherwise no news yours anne tuesday november 17 1942 dearest kitty mr dussel has arrived everything went smoothly miep told him to be at a certain place in front of the post office at 11 am when a man would me et him and he was at the appointed place at the appointed time mr kleiman wen t up to him announced that the man he was expecting to meet was unable to come and ask ed him to drop by the office to see miep mr kleiman took a streetcar back to th e office while mr dussel followed on foot it was eleventwenty when mr dussel tapped on the office doo r miep asked him to remove his coat so the yellow star couldnt be seen and brou ght him to the private office where mr kleiman kept him occupied until the cleani ng lady had gone on the pretext that the private office was needed for something els e miep took mr dussel upstairs opened the bookcase and stepped inside while mr dussellooked on in amazement in the meantime the seven of us had seated ourselves around t he dining table to await the latest addition to our family with coffee and cogna c miep first led him into the frank familys room he immediately recognized our furn iture but had no idea we were upstairs just above his head when miep told him he was so astonished he nearly fainted thank goodness she didnt leave him in suspe nse any longer but brought him upstairs mr dussel sank into a chair and stared at us in dumbstruck silence as though he thought he could read the truth on our fa ces then he stuttered aber but are you nicht in belgium the officer the auto they were not coming your escape was not working we explained the whole thing to him about how wed deliberat ely spread the rumor of the officer and the car to throw the germans and anyone else wh o might come looking for us off the track mr dussel was speechless in the face of s uch ingenuity and could do nothing but gaze around in surprise as he explored th e rest of our lovely and ultrapractical annex we all had lunch together then he too k a short nap joined us for tea put away the few belongings miep had been able to brin g here in advance and began to feel much more at home especially when we handed him the following typewritten rules and regulations for the secret annex a va n daan

d idnt mind sharing a room with me to be honest im not exactly delighted at havin g a stranger use my things but you have to make sacrifices for a good cause and i m glad i can make this small one if we can save even one of our friends the rest doe snt matter said father and hes absolutely right the first day mr dussel was here he asked me all sorts of ques tions for example what time the cleaning lady comes to the office how weve arranged to use the washroom and when were allowed to go to the toilet you ma y laugh but these things arent so easy in a hiding place during the daytime we cant make any noise that might be heard downstairs and when someone else is ther e like the cleaning lady we have to be extra careful i patiently explained all t his to mr dussel but i was surprised to see how slow he is to catch on he asks everyth ing twice and still cant remember what youve told him maybe hes just confused by the sudden change and hell get ov er it otherwise everything is going fine mr dussel has told us much about the outside world weve miss ed for so long he had sad news countless friends and acquaintances have been taken off to a dreadful fate night after night green and gray military vehicles cr uise the streets they knock on every door asking whether any jews live there if so the w hole family is immediately taken away if not they proceed to the next hous e its impossible to escape their clutches unless you go into hiding they often g o around with lists knocking only on those doors where they know theres a big hau l to be made they frequently offer a bounty so much per head its like the sla ve hunts of the olden days i dont mean to make light ofthisj its much too tragic f or that in the evenings when its dark i often see long lines of good innocent peopl e accompanied by crying children walking on and on ordered about by a handful of men who bully and beat them until they nearly drop no one is spared the sick the el derly children babies and pregnant women all are marched to their death were so fortunate here away from the turmoil we wouldnt h ave to give a moments thought to all this suffering if it werent for the fact that w ere so worried about those we hold dear whom we can no longer help i feel wicked sleepin g in a warm bed while somewhere out there my dearest friends are dropping fr om exhaustion or being knocked to the ground i get frightened myself when i think of close friends who are n ow at the mercy of the cruelest monsters ever to stalk the earth and all because theyre jews yours anne friday november 20 1942 dearest kitty we dont really know how to react up to now very little news ab out the jews had reached us here and we thought it best to stay as cheerful as p ossible every now and then miep used to mention what had happened to a friend an d mother or mrs van daan would start to cry so she decided it was better not to say any more but we bombarded mr dussel with questions and the stories he ha d to tell were so gruesome and dreadful that we cant get them out of our heads once weve had time to digest the news well probably go back to our usual joking and teasing it wont do us or those outside any good if we continue to be as gloomy as we are now and what would be the point of turning the secret annex into a mela ncholy annex no matter what im doing i cant help thinking about those wh o are gone i catch myself laughing and remember that its a disgrace to be so che erful but am i supposed to spend the whole day crying no i cant do that th is gloom will pass added to this misery theres another but of a more personal n ature and it pales in comparison to the suffering ive just told you about still i cant help telling you that lately ive begun to feel deserted im surrounded by too gre at a void i never used to give it much thought since my mind was filled with my friends and having a good time now i think either about unhappy things or about myself its taken a while but ive finally realized that father no matter how kind he may b e cant take the place of my former world when it comes to my feelings mother and marg ot ceased to count long ago but why do i bother you with this foolishness im terribly un grateful kitty i know but when ive been scolded for the umpteenth time and have all these other woes to think about as well my head begins to reel yours anne saturday november 2g 1942 dearest kitty weve been using too much electricity and have now exceeded o ur ration the result excessive economy and the prospect of having the electricit y cut off no light for fourteen days thats a pleasant thought isnt it but who k nows maybe it wont be so long its too dark to read after four or fourthirty so we wh ile away the time with all kinds of crazy activities telling riddles doing calis thenics in the dark speaking english or french reviewing books after a while everythi ng gets boring yesterday i discovered a new pastime using a good pair of binoculars to peek into the lighted rooms of the neighbors during the day our curtains cant be o pened not even an inch but theres no harm when its so dark i never knew that neighbors could be so interesting ours are at any rate ive come across a few at dinner one family making home movies and the d entist across the way working on a frightened old lady mr dussel the man who was said to get along so well with child ren and to absolutely adore them has turned out to be an oldfashioned disciplina rian and preacher of unbearably long sermons on manners since i have the singula r pleasure of sharing my far too narrow room with his excellency and since im gene rally considered to be the worst behaved of the three young people its all i can do t o avoid having the same old scoldings and admonitions repeatedly flung at my he ad and to pretend not to hear this wouldnt be so bad if mr dussel werent such a tatt letale and hadnt singled out mother to be the recipient of his reports if mr d ussels just read me the riot act mother lectures me all over again this time throwi ng the whole book at me and if im really lucky mrs van d calls me to account five mi nutes later and lays down the law as well really its not easy being the badly broughtup center of at tention of a family of nitpickers in bed at night as i ponder my many sins and exaggerated short comings i get so confused by the sheer amount of things i have to consider that i either laugh or cry depending on my mood then i fall asleep with the strange feel ing of wanting to be different than i am or being different than i want to be or per haps of behaving differently than i am or want to be oh dear now im confusing you too forgive me but i dont lik e crossing things out and in these times of scarcity tossing away a piece of paper is clearly taboo so i can only advise you not to reread the above passage and to make no attempt to get to the bottom of it because youll never find your way out again yours anne monday december 7 1942 dearest kitty hanukkah and st nicholas day nearly coincided this year th ey were only one day apart we didnt make much of a fuss with hanukkah merely exc hanging a few small gifts and lighting the candles since candles are in short su pply we lit them for only ten minutes but as long as we sing the song that doesnt matt er mr van daan made a menorah out of wood so that was taken care of too st nicholas day on saturday was much more fun during dinner bep and miep were so busy whispering to father that our curiosity was aroused a nd we suspected they were up to something sure enough at eight oclock we all tro oped downstairs through the hall in pitch darkness it gave me the shivers an d i wished i was safely back upstairs to the alcove we could switch on the light s ince this room doesnt have any windows when that was done father opened the big ca binet oh how wonderful we all cried in the corner was a large basket decorated with colorful pape r and a mask of black peter we quickly took the basket upstairs with us inside was a litt le gift for everyone including an appropriate verse since youre famthar with t he kinds of poems peo ple write each other on st nicholas day i wont copy them down fo r you i received a kewpie doll father got bookends and so on well anyway it was a nice idea and since the eight of us had never celebrated st nicho las day before this was a good time to begin yours anne ps we also had presents for everyone downstairs a few thing s left over from the good old days plus miep and bep are always grateful for money today we heard that mr van daan s ashtray mr dussels pict ure frame and fathers bookends were made by none other than mr voskuijl how anyon e can be so clever with his hands is a mystery to me thursday december 10 1942 dearest kitty mr van daan used to be in the meat sausage and spice business he was hired for his knowledge of spices and yet to our great delight its h is sausage talents that have come in handy now we ordered a large amount of meat under the counter of cours e that we were planning to preserve in case there were hard times ahead mr van daan decided to make bratwurst sausages and mettwurst i had fun watching h im put the meat through the grinder once twice three times then he added the remaining ingredi ents to the ground meat and used a long pipe to force the mixtur e into the casings we ate the bratwurst with sauerkraut for lunch but the sausa ges which were going to be canned had to dry first so we hung them over a pole suspe nded from the cethng everyone who came into the room burst into laughter w hen they saw the dangling sausagesit was such a comical sight the kitchen was a shambles mr van daan clad in his wifes ap ron and looking fatter than ever was working away at the meat what with his bloody h ands red face and spotted apron he looked like a real butcher mrs d was tryi ng to do everything at once learning dutch out of a book stirring the soup watchi ng the meat sighing and moaning about her broken rib thats what happens when old ladies do such stupid exercises to get rid of their fat behinds dussel had an eye in fection and was sitting next to the stove dabbing his eye with camomile tea pim seat ed in the one ray of sunshine coming through the window kept having to move his c hair this way and that to stay out of the way his rheumatism must have been botherin g him because he was slightly hunched over and was keeping an eye on mr van daa n with an agonized expression on his face he reminded me of those aged invalids you see in the poorhouse peter was romping around the room with mouschi the cat while mother margot and i were peeling boiled potatoes when you get right down to it none of us were doing our work properly because we were all so busy watc hing mr van daan dussel has opened his dental practice just for fun ill des cribe the session with his very first patient mother was ironing and mrs van d the first victim sat dow n on a chair in the middle of the room dussel unpacking his case with an air of i mportance asked for some eau de cologne which could be used as a disinfectant an d vaseline which would have to do for wax he looked in mrs van ds mouth and found tw o teeth that made her wince with pain and utter incoherent cries every time he t ouched them after a lengthy examination lengthy as far as mrs van d was concer ned since it actually took no longer than two minutes dussel began to scrape out a cavity but mrs van d had no intention of letting him she flailed her arms and le gs until dussel finally let go of his probe and it remained stuck in mrs van ds tooth that really did it mrs van d lashed out wildly in all directions cried as muc h as you can with an instrument like that in your mouth tried to remove it but o nly managed to push it in even farther mr dussel calmly observed the scene his ha nds on his hips while the rest of the audience roared with laughter of course tha t was very mean of us if itd been me im sure i would have yelled even louder afte r a great deal of squirming kicking screaming and shouting mrs van d fin ally managed to yank the thing out and mr dussel went on with his work as if nothing ha d happened he was so quick that mrs van d didnt have time to pull any more shen anigans but then he had more help than hes ever had before no fewer than two assi s tants mr van d and i performed our job well the whole scene resembled one of those engravings from the middle ages entitled a quack at work in the meanti me however the patient was getting restless since she had to keep an eye on her soup and her food one thing is certain itll be a while before mrs van d makes another dental appointment yours anne sunday december 13 1942 dearest kitty im sitting here nice and cozy in the front office peering ou t through a chink in the heavy curtains its dusky but theres just enough light to write by its really strange watching people walk past they all seem to be in such a hurry that they nearly trip over their own feet those on bicycles w hiz by so fast i cant even tell whos on the bike the people in this neighborhood a rent particularly attractive to look at the children especially are so dirty y ou wouldnt want to touch them with a tenfoot pole real slum kids with runny noses i c an hardly understand a word they say yesterday afternoon when margot and i were taking a bath i s aid what if we took a fishing rod and reeled in each of those kids one by one as they walked by stuck them in the tub washed and mended their clothes and then and then tomorrow theyd be just as dirty and tattered as the y were before margot replied but im babbling there are also other things to look at cars boats and the rain i can hear the streetcar and the children and im enjoying myself our thoughts are subject to as little change as we are theyr e like a merrygoround turning from the jews to food from food to p olitics by the way speaking of jews i saw two yesterday when i was peeking throu gh the curtains i felt as though i were gazing at one of the seven wonders of the w orld it gave me such a funny feeling as if id denounced them to the authorit ies and was now spying on their misfortune across from us is a houseboat the captain lives there with hi s wife and children he has a small yapping dog we know the little dog only by its bark and by its tail which we can see whenever it runs around the deck oh what a sh ame its just started raining and most of the people are hidden under their umbrellas all i can see are raincoats and now and again the back of a stockingcappe d head actually i dont even need to look by now i can recognize the women at a gl ance gone to fat from eating potatoes dressed in a red or green coat and worn out shoes a shopping bag dangling from their arms with faces that are either grim or goodhumored depending on the mood of their husbands yours anne tuesday december 22 1942 dearest kitty the annex was delighted to hear that well all be receiving an extra quarter pound of butter for christmas according to the newspaper everyone is entitled to half a pound but they mean those lucky souls who get their ration books fro m the government not jews in hiding like us who can only afford to buy four rather th an eight ration books on the black market each of us is going to bake something with the butter this morning i made two cakes and a batch of cookies its very busy upstairs and mother has informed me that im not to do any studying or readi ng until all the household chores have been finished mrs van daan is lying in bed nursing her bruised rib she comp lains all day long constantly demands that the bandages be changed and is gener ally dissatisfied with everything ill be glad when she gets back on her feet and can clean up after herself because i must admit shes extraordinarily hardworking a nd neat and as long as shes in good physical and mental condition shes quite cheerful as if i dont hear shh shh enough during the day because im always making too much noise my dear roommate has come up with the idea of sayi ng shh shh to me all night too according to him i shouldnt even turn over i refuse to take any notice of him and the next time he shushes me im going to shu sh him right back he gets more exasperating and egotistical as the days go by e xcept for the first week i havent seen even one of the cookies he so generously p romised me hes partic ularly infuriating on sundays when he switches on th e light at the crack of dawn to exercise for ten minutes to me the torment seems to last for hours since the chairs i u se to make my bed longer are constantly being jiggled under my sleepy head af ter rounding off his limberingup exercises with a few vigorous arm swings his l ordship begins dressing his underwear is hanging on a hook so first he lumbers over to get it and then lumbers back past my bed but his tie is on the table so once a gain he pushes and bumps his way past the chairs but i mustnt waste any more of your time griping about disgus ting old men it wont help matters anyway my plans for revenge such as unscrewin g the lightbulb locking the door and hiding his clothes have unfortu nately had to be abandoned in the interests of peace oh im becoming so sensible weve got to be reasonable abou t everything we do here studying listen ing holding our tongues helping ot hers being kind making compromises and i dont know what else im afraid my common s ense which was in short supply to begin with will be used up too quickly and i wo nt have any left by the time the war is over yours anne wednesday january 13 1943 dearest kitty this morning i was constantly interrupted and as a result i h avent been able to finish a single thing ive begun we have a new pastime namely filling packages with powdere d gravy the gravy is one of gies cos products mr kugler hasnt been able to fi nd anyone else to fill the packages and besides its cheaper if we do the job

out of their homes theyre allowed to take only a knapsack and a little cash with them and even then theyre robbed of t hese possessions on the way families are torn apart men women and children are

thin shirts a nd wooden shoes they have no coats no caps no stockings and no one to help them gn awing on a carrot to still their hunger pangs they walk from their cold houses th rough cold streets to an even colder classroom things have gotten so bad in holland t hat hordes of children stop passersby in the streets to beg for a piece of bread i could spend hours telling you about the suffering the war ha s brought but id only make myself more miserable all we can do is wait as calmly as possible for it to end jews and christians alike are waiting the whole world i s waiting and many are waiting

suddenly all would be forgotten and shed treat me like e veryone else its impossible for me to be all smiles one day and venomous th e next id rather choose the golden mean which isnt so golden and keep my tho ughts to myself perhaps sometime ill treat the others with the same contemp t as they treat me oh if only i could yours anne friday february 5 1943 dearest kitty though its been ages since ive written to you about the squa bbles theres still no change in the begin ning mr dussel took our soonforgotten clashes very seriously but now hes grown used to them and no longer tries to mediatemargot and peter arent exactly what youd call young the yre both so quiet and boring next to them i stick out like a sore thumb and im alw ays being told margot and peter dont act that way why dont you follow you r sisters example i hate that i confess that i have absolutely no desire to be like margot s hes too weakwilled and passive to suit me she lets herself be swayed by others an d always backs down under pressure i want to have more spunk but i keep ideas lik e these to myself theyd only laugh at me if i offered this in my defense during meals the air is filled with tension fortunately th e outbursts are sometimes held in check by the soup eaters the people from the office who come up to have a cup of soup for lunch this afternoon mr van daan again brought up the fact that mar got eats so little i suppose you do it to keep your figure he added in a mocking to ne mother who always comes to margots defense said in a loud v oice i cant stand that stupid chatter of yours a minute longer mrs van d turned red as a beet mr van d stared straight ahe ad and said nothing still we often have a good laugh not long ago mrs van d was e ntertaining us with some bit of nonsense or another she was talking about the pas t about how well she got along with her father and what a flirt she was and you know she continued my father told me that if a gentleman ever got fre sh i was to say remem ber sir that im a lady and hed know what i meant we split our sides laughing as if shed told us a good joke even peter though hes usually quiet occasionally gives r ise to hilarity he has the misfortune of adoring foreign words without knowing what th ey mean one afternoon we couldnt use the toilet because there were visitors in the office unable to wait he went to the bathroom but didnt flush the toilet to warn us of the unpleasant odor he tacked a sign to the bathroom door rsvp gas of c ourse he meant danger gas but he thought rsvp looked more elegant h e didnt have the faintest idea that it meant please reply yours anne saturday february 27 1943 dearest kitty pim is expecting the invasion any day now churchill has had p neumonia but is gradually getting better gandhi the champion of indian fr eedom is on one of his umpteenth hunger strikes mrs van d claims shes fatalistic but whos the most afrai d when the guns go off none other than petronella van daan jan brought along the episcopal letter that the bishops addr essed to their parishioners it was beautiful and inspiring people of the netherlands stand up and take action each of us must choose our own weapons to fight for the freedom of our country our people and our reli gion give your help and support act n ow this is what theyre preaching from the pulpit will it do any good its d efinitely too late to help our fellow jews guess whats happened to us now the owner of the building sol d it without informing mr kugler and mr kleiman one morning the new landlord arri ved with an architect to look the place over thank goodness mr kleiman was in the o ffice he showed the gentlemen all there was to see with the exception of the secr et annex he claimed hed left the key at home and the new owner asked no further que stions if only he doesnt come back demanding to see the annex in that case we ll be in big trouble father emptied a card file for margot and me and filled it with index cards that are blank on one side this is to become our reading file in which margot and i are supposed to note down the books weve read the author and the date ive learned two new words brothel and coquette ive bought a separ ate notebook for new words theres a new division of butter and margarine each person i s to get their portion on their own plate the distribution is very unfair the van daa ns who always make breakfast for everyone give themselves one and a half times more than they do us my parents are much too afraid of an argument to say anything which is a shame because i think people like that should always be given a tast e of their own medicine yours anne thursday march 4 1943 dearest kitty mrs van d has a new nickname weve started calling her mrs beaverbrook of course that doesnt mean anything to you so let me explain a certain mr beaverbrook often talks on the english radio about what he co nsiders to be the far too lenient bombardment of germany mrs van daan who always co ntradicts everyone including churchill and the news reports is in complete agr eement with mr beaverbrook so we thought it would be a good idea for her to be married to him and since she was flattered by the notion weve decided to call h er mrs beaverbrook from now on were getting a new warehouse employee since the old one is b eing sent to germany thats bad for him but good for us because the new one wont be famthar with the building were still afraid of the men who work in th e warehouse gandhi is eating again the black market is doing a booming business if we had enough money to pay the ridiculous prices we could stuff ourselves silly our gree ngrocer buys potatoes from the wehrmacht and brings them in sacks to the private offic e since he suspects were hiding here he makes a point of coming during lunchtim e when the warehouse employees are out so much pepper is being ground at the moment that we sneeze and cough with every breath we take everyone who comes upstairs greets us with an ahchoo mrs van d swears she wont go downstairs one more whiff of pepper an d shes going to get sick i dont think father has a very nice business noth ing but pec tin and pepper as long as youre in the food business why not make candy a veritable thunderstorm of words came crashing down on me ag ain this morning the air flashed with so many coarse expressions that my ears w ere ringing with annes bad this annd van daans good that fire and brims tone yours anne wednesday march 10 1943 dearest kitty we had a short circuit last night and besides that the guns w ere booming away until dawn i still havent gotten over my fear of planes and shooti ng and i crawl into fathers bed nearly every night for comfort i know it sounds childish but wait till it happens to you the ackack guns make so much noise you cant h ear your own voice mrs beaverbrook the fatalist practically burst i nto tears and said in a timid little voice oh its so awful oh the guns are so loud which is another way of saying im so scared it didnt seem nearly as bad by candlelight as it did in the dar k i was shivering as if i had a fever and begged father to relight the candle he was adamant there was to be n o light suddenly we heard a burst of machinegun fire and thats ten times worse than antiaircraft guns mother jumped out of bed and to pims great annoyance lit th e candle her resolute answer to his grumbling was after all anne is not an exsol dier and that was the end of that have i told you any of mrs van ds other fears i dont think s o to keep you up to date on the latest adventures in the secret annex i should tell you this as well one night mrs van d thought she heard loud footsteps in the a ttic and she was so afraid of burglars she woke her husband at that very same mo ment the thieves disappeared and the only sound mr van d could hear was the f rightened pounding of his fatalistic wifes heart oh putti she cried putti is mrs van ds pet name for her husband they must have taken all our sausages and drie d beans and what about peter oh do you think peters still safe and sound in h is bed im sure they havent stolen peter stop being such a ninny and let me get back to sleep impossible mrs van d was too scared to sleep a few nights later the entire van daan family was awakened by g hostly noises peter went to the attic with a flashlight and scurry scurry wh at do you think he saw running away a whole slew of enormous rats once we knew who the thieves were we let mouschi sleep in the a ttic and never saw our uninvited guests again at least not at night a few evenings ago it was seventhirty and still light pet er went up to the loft to get some old newspapers he had to hold on tightly to the trapd oor to climb down the ladder he put down his hand without looking and nearly fell off the ladder from shock and pain without realizing it hed put his hand on a la rge rat which had bitten him in the arm by the time he reached us white as a sheet and wi th his knees knocking the blood had soaked through his pajamas no wonde r he was so shaken since petting a rat isnt much fun especially when it takes a chunk out of your arm yours anne friday march 12 1943 dearest kitty may i introduce mama frank the childrens advocate extra butter for the youngsters the problems facing todays youth you name it and mother d efends the younger generation after a skirmish or two she always gets her way one of the jars of pickled tongue is spoiled a feast for mousc hi and boche you havent met boche yet despite the fact that she was here b efore we went into hiding shes the warehouse and office cat who keeps the rat s at bay in the storeroom her odd political name can easily be explained for a while t he firm gies co had two cats one for the warehouse and one for the attic their pa ths crossed from time to time which invariably resulted in a fight the wareh ouse cat was always the aggressor while the attic cat was ultimately the victor ju st as in politics so the warehouse cat was named the german or boche and the attic cat the englishman or tommy sometime after that they got rid of tommy but boc he is always there to amuse us when we go downstairs vveve eaten so many brown beans and navy beans that i cant st and to look at them just thinking about them makes me sick our evening serving of bread has been canceled daddy just said that hes not in a very cheerful mood his eyes look so sad again the poor man i cant tear myself away from the book a knock at the door by ina bakker boudier this family saga is extremely well written but the parts dea ling with war writers and the emancipation of women arent very good to be honest the se subjects dont interest me much terrible bombing raids on germany mr van daan is grouchy t he reason the cigarette shortage the debate about whether or not to start eating the canned foo d ended in our favor i cant wear any of my shoes except my ski boots which are not very practical around the house a pair of straw thongs that were purchased f or 650 guilders were worn down to the soles within a week maybe miep will be able to scrounge up something on the black market its time to cut fathers hair pim swears that i do such a good job hell never go to another barber after the war if only i didnt nick his ear so o ften yours anne thursday march 18 1943 my dearest kitty turkeys entered the war great excitement anxiously awai ting radio reports friday march 19 1943 dearest kitty in less than an hour joy was followed by disappoint ment tur key hasnt entered the war yet it was only a cabinet minister talking about turkey g iving up its neu trality sometime soon the newspaper vendor in dam square was shouti ng turkey on englands side and the papers were being snatched out of hi s hands this was how wed heard the encouraging rumor thousandguilder notes are being declared invalid thatl l be a blow to the black marketeers and others like them but even more to pe ie in hidi ng and anyone else with money that cant be accounted for to turn in a thousand guilder bill you have to be able to state how you came by it and provide proof they ca n still be used to pay taxes but only until next week the fivehundred notes w ill lapse at the same time gies co still had some unaccountedfor thousandgu ilder bills which they used to pay their estimated taxes for the coming years so eve rything seems to be aboveboard dussel has received an oldfashioned footoperated denti sts drill that means ill probably be getting a thorough checkup soon dussel is terribly lax when it comes to obeying the rules of th e house not only does he write letters to his charlotte hes also carrying on a cha tty correspondence with various other people margot the annexs dutch teacher ha s been correcting these letters for him father has forbidden him to keep up the pract ice and margot has stopped correcting the letters but i think it wont be long b efore he starts up again the fuhrer has been talking to wounded soldiers we listened on the radio and it was pathetic the questions and answers went something like thi s my name is heinrich scheppel where were you wounded near stalingrad what kind of wound is it two frostbitten feet and a fracture of the left arm this is an exact report of the hideous puppet show aired on the radio the wounded seemed proud of their wounds the more the better one was so beside himself at the thought of shaking hands i presume he still had one with the fuhrer that he could barely say a word i happened to drop dussels soap on the floor and step on it no w theres a whole piece missing ive already asked father to compensate him f or the damages especially since dussel only gets one bar of inferior wartime soap a mont h yours anne thursday march 25 1943 dearest kitty mother father margot and i were sitting quite pleasantly t ogether last night when peter suddenly came in and whispered in fathers ear i caugh t the words a barrel falling over in the warehouse and someone fiddling with th e door margot heard it too but was trying to calm me down since id t urned white as chalk and was extremely nervous the three of us waited while fathe r and peter went downstairs a minute or two later mrs van daan came up from wh ere shed been listening to the radio and told us that pim had asked her to tur n it off and tiptoe upstairs but you know what happens when youre trying to be q uiet the old stairs creaked twice as loud five minutes later peter and pim the c olor drained from their faces appeared again to relate their experiences they had positioned themselves under the staircase and wait ed nothing happened then all of a sudden they heard a couple of bangs as if two door s had been slammed shut inside the house pim bounded up the stairs whi le peter went to warn dussel who finally pre sented himself upstairs though not without kicking up a fuss and making a lot of noise then we all tiptoed in our stockinge d feet to the van daans on the next floor mr van d had a bad cold and had already gone to bed so we gathered around his bedside and discussed our suspicions in a whisper every time mr van d coughed loudly mrs van d and i nearly had a nervous fi t he kept coughing until someone came up with the bright idea of giving him codei ne his cough subsided immediately once again we waited and waited but heard nothing finally w e came to the conclusion that the burglars had taken to their heels when th ey heard footsteps in an otherwise quiet building the problem now was that the chair s in the private office were neatly grouped around the radio which was tuned to engl and if the burglars had forced the door and the airraid wardens were to notice it and call the police there could be very serious repercus sions so mr van daan go t up pulled on his coat and pants put on his hat and cautiously followed father down the stairs with peter armed with a heavy hammer to be on the safe side right behin d him the ladies including margot and me waited in suspense until the men re turned five minutes later and reported that there was no sign of any activity in th e building we agreed not to run any water or flush the toilet but since everyones stomach was churning from all the tension you can imagine the stench after wed ea ch had a turn in the bathroom incidents like these are always accompanied by other disast ers and this was no exception number one the westertoren bells stopped chimi ng and id always found them so comforting number two mr voskuijlleft early last night and we werent sure if hed given bep the key and shed forgotten to lock the d oor but that was of little importance now the night had just begu n and we still werent sure what to expect we were somewhat reassured by the fact th at between eightfifteen when the burglar had first entered the buil ding and put our lives in jeopardy and tenthirty we hadnt heard a sound the more w e thought about it the less likely it seemed that a burglar would have forced a door s o early in the evening when there were still people out on the streets besides that it occurred to us that the warehouse manager at the keg company next door might stil l have been at work what with the excitement and the thin walls its easy to mist ake the sounds besides your imagination often plays tricks on you in momen ts of danger so we went to bed though not to sleep father and mother and mr dussel were awake most of the night and im not exaggerating when i say th at i hardly got a wink of sleep this morning the men went downstairs to see if the ou tside door was still locked but all was well of course we gave the entire office staff a blowbyblow acc ount of the incident which had been far from pleasant its much easier to laugh at these kinds of things after theyve happened and bep was the only one who took us se riously yours anne ps this morning the toilet was clogged and father had to sti ck in a long wooden pole and fish out several pounds of excrement and strawberry recipes which is what we use for toilet paper these days afterward we burned the p ole saturday march 27 1943 dearest kitty weve finished our shorthand course and are now working on im proving our speed arent we smart let me tell you more about my time killers this is what i call my courses because all we ever do is try to make the days go by a s quickly as possible so we are that much closer to the end of our time here i adore mythology espe cially the greek and roman gods everyone here thinks my interest is just a passing fancy since theyve never heard of a teenager with a n appreciation of mythology well then i guess im the first mr van daan has a cold or rather he has a scratchy throat bu t hes making an enormous todo over it he gargles with camomile tea coats t he roof of his mouth with a tincture of myrrh and rubs mentholatum over his chest nose gums and tongue and to top it off hes in a foul mood rauter some german bigwig recently gave a speech all jew s must be out of the germanoccupied territories before july 1 the province of utrecht will be cleansed of jews as if they were cockroaches between april 1 and may 1 and the provinces of north and south holland between may 1 and june 1 these poo r people are being shipped off to filthiy slaughterhouses like a herd of sick an d neglected cattle but ill say no more on the subject my own thoughts give me nightmares one good piece of news is that the labor exchange was set on fir e in an act of sabotage a few days later the county clerks office also wen t up in flames men posing as german police bound and gagged the guards and manag ed to destroy some important documents yours anne thursday april 1 1943 dearest kitty im not really in the mood for pranks see the date on the contrary today i can safely quote the saying misfort unes never come singly first mr kleiman our merry sunshine had another bout of g astrointestinal hemorrhaging yesterday and will have to stay in bed for at lea st three weeks i should tell you that his stomach has been bothering him quite a bit and theres no cure second bep has the flu third mr voskuijl has to go to the hospital next week he probably has an ulcer and will have to undergo surgery fou rth the managers of pomosin industries came from frankfurt to discuss the new op ekta deliveries father had gone yer the important points with mr kleiman and there wasnt enough time to give mr kugler a thor ough briefing the gentlemen arrived from frankfurt and father was alread y shaking at the thought of how the talks would go if only i could be there if only i we re downstairs he exclaimed go lie down with your ear to the floor theyll be brought to t he private office and youll be able to hear everything fathers face cleared and yesterday morning at tenthirty margot and pim two ears are better than one took up their posts on the floor by noon t he talks werent finished but father was in no shape to continue his listen in g campaign he was in agony from having to lie for hours in such an unusual and uncom fortable position at twothirty we heard voices in the hall and i took his place m argot kept me company the conversation was so longwinded and boring tha t i suddenly fell asleep on the cold hard linoleum margot didnt dare touch me for fe ar theyd hear us and of course she couldnt shout i slept for a good half hour and the n awoke with a start having forgotten every word of the important discussion lu ckily margot had paid more attention yours anne friday april 2 1943 dearest kitty oh my another item has been added to my list of sins last nigh t was lying in bed waiting for father to tuck me in an say my prayers with me when mother came into the room sat on my bed and asked very gently anne daddy isn t ready how about if i listen to your prayers tonight no momsy i replied mother got up stood beside my bed for a moment and then slowly walked toward the door suddenly she turned her face contorted with pain and said i dont want to be angry with you i cant make you love me a few tears slid down her cheeks as she went out the door i lay still thinking how mean it was of me to reject her so crue lly but i also knew that i was incapable of answering her any other way i cant be a hypocrite and pray with her when i dont feel like it it just doesnt work that wa y i felt sorry for mother very very sorry because for the first time in my l ife i noticed she wasnt indifferent to my coldness i saw the sorrow in her fac e when she talked about not being able to make me love her its hard to tell the truth and yet the truth is that shes the one whos rejected me shes the one whose tact less comments and cruel jokes about matters i dont think are funny have made me insensitive to any sign of love on her part just as my heart sinks every time i hear her harsh words thats how her heart sank when she realized there was no more love bet ween us she cried half the night and didnt get any sleep father has a voided looking at me and if his eyes do happen to cross mine i can read his unspoken words how can you be so unkind how dare you make your mother so sad everyone expects me to apologize but this is not something i can apologize for because i told the truth and sooner or later mothjr was bound to find out anyway i seem to be indifferent to mothers tears and fathers glance s and i am because both of them are now feeling what ive always felt i can only feel s orry for mother who will have to figure out what her attitude should be all by hers elf for my part i will continue to remain silent and aloof and i dont intend to shr ink from the truth because the longer its postponed the harder it will be for t hem to accept it when they do hear it yours anne tuesday april 27 1943 dearest kitty the house is still trembling from the aftereffects of the qua rrels everyone is mad at everyone else mother and i mr van daan and father mother a nd mrs van d terrific atmosphere dont you think once again annes usu al list of shortcomings has been extensively aired our german visitors were back last saturday they stayed unt il six we all sat upstairs not daring to move an inch if theres no one else wo rking in the building or in the neighborhood you can hear every single step in the pri vate office ive got ants in my pants again from having to sit still so long mr voskuijl has been hospitalized but mr kleimans back a t the office his stomach stopped bleeding sooner than it normally does he told us tha t the county clerks office took an extra beating because the firemen flooded the entire building instead of just putting out the fire that does my heart good the carlton hotel has been destroyed two british planes loa ded with firebombs landed right on top of the german officers club the entire corner of vijzelstraat an d singel has gone up in flames the number of air strikes on german cities is increas ing daily we havent had a good nights rest in ages and i have bags under my eyes from l ack of sleep our food is terrible breakfast consists of plain unbutter ed brea and ersatz coffee for the last two weeks lunch has been e spinach or cooked lettuce with huge potatoes that have a rotten sweetish taste if youre trying to diet the annex is the place to be upstairs they complain bitterly but we dont think its such a tragedy all the dutch men who either fought or were mobilized in 1940 h ave been called up to work in prisonerofwar camps i bet theyre taking this p recaution because of the invasion yours anne saturday may 1 1943 dearest kitty yesterday was dussels birthday at first he acted as if he di dnt want to celebrate it but when miep arrived with a large shopping bag overflowing w ith gifts he was as excited as a little kid his darling lotje has sent him egg s butter cookies lemonade bread cognac spice cake flowers oranges cho colate books and writing paper he piled his presents on a table and displayed them for no fewer than three days the silly old goat you mustnt get the idea that hes starving we found bread c heese jam and eggs in his cupboard its absolutely disgraceful that dussel who m weve treated with such kindness and whom we took in to save from destruction should stuff himself behind our backs and not give us anything after all weve shared al l we had with him but whats worse in our opinion is that hes so stingy with resp ect to mr kleiman mr voskuijl and bep he doesnt give them a thing in dussels vi ew the oranges that kleiman so badly needs for his sick stomach will benefit his o wn stomach even more tonight the guns have been banging away so much that ive alre ady had to gather up my belongings four times today i packed a suitcase wl fthe s tuff id need in case we had to flee but as m ther correctly noted where would you go all of holland is being punishe or the workers strikes mart ial law has been declared and everyone is going to get one less butter coupon what naug hty children i washed mothers hair this evening which is no easy task the se days we have to use a very sticky liquid cleanser because theres no more sha mpoo besides that moms had a hard time combing her hair because the family comb h as only ten teeth left yours anne sunday may 2 1943 when i think about our lives here i usually come to the conclu sion that we live in a paradise compared to the jews who arent in hiding all the sa me later on when everything has returned to normal ill probably wonder how we who always lived in such comfortable circumstances could have sunk so low w ith respect to manners i mean for example the same oilcloth has covered the dining t able ever since weve been here after so much use its hardly what youd call spot less i do my best to clean it but since the dishcloth was also purchased before w e went into hiding and consists of more holes than cloth its a thankless task the van daans have been sleeping all winter long on the same flannel sheet which can t be washed because detergent is rationed and in short supply besides its of s uch poor quality that its practically useless father is walking around in frayed tro users and his tie is also showing signs of wear and tear mamas corset snapped today a nd is beyond repair while margot is wearing a bra thats two sizes too small moth er and margot have shared the same three undershorts the entire winter and min e are so small they dont even cover my stomach these are all things that can be overco me but i sometimes wonder how can we whose every possession from my underpan ts to fathers shaving brush is so old and worn ever hope to regain the position we h ad before the war sunday may 2 1943 the attitude of the annex residents toward the war mr van daan in the opinion of us all this revered gentleman has great insight into politics nevertheless he predicts well have to stay here until the end of 43 thats a very long time and yet its possible to hold out until then but who can assure us that this war which has caused nothing but pain and sorrow w ill then be over and that nothing will have happened to us and our helpers long bef ore that time no one thats why each and every day is filled with tension expecta tion and hope generate tension as does fear for example when we hear a noise insi de or outside the house when the guns go off or when we read new proclamations in the paper since were afraid our helpers might be forced to go into hiding the mselves sometime these days everyone is talking about having to hide we dont know h ow many people are actually in hiding of course the number is relatively smal l compared to the general population but later on well no doubt be astonished at how m any good people in holland were willing to take jews and christians with or wit hout money into their homes therere also an unbelievable number of people with f alse identity papers mrs van daan when this beautiful damsel by her own account heard that it was getting easier these days to obtain false ids she immediate ly proposed that we each have one made as if there were nothing to it as if father and m r van daan were made of money mrs van daan is always sating the most ridiculous things an d her putti is often exasperated but thats not surprising because one day ker li announces when this is allover im going to have myself baptized and the next a s long as i can remember ive wanted to go to jerusalem i only feel at home with other j ews pim is a big optimist but he always has his reasons mr dussel makes up everything as he goes along and anyone wi shing to contradict his majesty had better think twice in alfred dussels home h is word is law but that doesnt suit anne frank in the least what the other members of the annex family think about the war doesnt matter when it comes to politics these four are the only ones who cou nt actually only two of them do but madame van daan and dussel include themselves as well tuesday may 18 1943 dearest kit i recently witnessed a fierce dogfight between german and en glish pilots unfortunately a couple of allied airmen had to jump out of th eir burning plane our milkman who lives in halfweg saw four canadians sitting al ong the side of the road and one of them spoke fluent dutch he asked the milkman if he h ad a light for his cigarette and then told him the crew had consisted of six men the pilot had been burned to death and the fifth crew member had hidden himself somewhere the german security police came to pick up the four remaining men none of whom were injured after parachuting out of a flaming plane how can an yone have such presence of mind although its undeniably hot we have to light a fire every ot her day to burn our vegetable peelings and garbage we cant throw anything int o trash cans because the warehouse employees might see it one small act of carelessn ess and were done for all college students are being asked to sign an official stat ement to the effect that they sympathize with the germans and approve of the new orde r eighty percent have decided to obey the dictates of their conscience but th e penalty will be severe any student refusing to sign will be sent to a german labor cam p whats to become of the youth of our country if theyve all got to do hard labor i n germany last night the guns were making so much noise that mother shut the window i was in pims bed suddenly right above our heads we heard mrs v an d leap up as if shed been bitten by mouschi this was followed by a loud boom which sounded as if a firebomb had landed beside my bed lights lights i scre amed pim switched on the lamp i expected the room to burst into fla mes any minute nothing happened we all rushed upstairs to see what was goin g on mr and mrs van d had seen a red glow through the open window and he thought t here was a fire nearby while she was certain our house was ablaze mrs van d was already standing beside her bed with her knees knocking when the boom came dus sel stayed upstairs to smoke a cigarette and we crawled back into bed less than f ifteen minutes later the shooting started again mrs van d sprang out of bed and w ent downstairs to dussel s room to seek the comfort she was unable to find with h er spouse dussel welcomed her with the words come into my bed my child we burst into peals of laughter and the roar of the guns bothe red us no more our fears had all been swept away yours anne sunday june 13 1943 dearest kitty the poem father composed for my birthday is too nice to keep to myself since pim writes his verses only in german margot volunteer ed to translate it into dutch see for yourself whether margot hasnt done herself p roud it begins with the usual summary of the years events and then continues as youngest among us but small no more your life can be trying for we have the chore of becoming your teachers a terrible bore weve got experience take it from me weve done this all before you see we know the ropes we know the same since time immemorial always the same ones own shortcomings are nothing but fluff but everyone elses are heavier stuff faultfinding comes easy when this is our plight but its hard for your parents try as they might to treat you with fairness and kindness as well nitpickings a habit thats hard to dispel men youre living with old folks all you can do is put up with their nagging its hard but its true the pill may be bitter but down it must go for its meant to keep the peace you know the many months here have not been in vain since wasting time noes against your brain you read and study nearly all the day determined to chase the boredom away the more difficult question much harder to bear is what on earth do i have to wear ive got no more panties my clothes are too tight my shirt is a loincloth im really a siaht to put on my shoes i must off my toes dh dear im plagued with so many woes margot had trouble getting the part about food to rhyme so i m leaving it out but aside from that dont you think its a good poem for the rest ive been thoroughly spoiled and have received a number of lovely presents including a big book on my favorite subject greek and roman mythology nor can i complain about the lack of candy everyone had dippe d into their last reserves as the benjamin of the annex i got more than i deser ve yours anne tuesday june 15 1943 dearest kitty heaps of things have happened but i often think im boring yo u with my dreary chitchat and that youd just as soon have fewer letters so i ll keep the news brief mr voskuijl wasnt operated on for his ulcer after all once the doctors had him on the operating table and opened him up they saw that he had can cer it was in such an advanced stage that an operation was pointless so they stit ched him up again kept him in the hospital for three weeks fed him well and sent him b ack home but they made an unforgivable error they told the poor man exactly wh at was in store for him he cant work anymore and hes just sitting at home surroun ded by his eight children brooding about his approaching death i feel very sorry for h im and hate not being able to go out otherwise id visit him as often as i could and help take his mind off matters now the good man can no longer let us know whats bein g said and done in the warehouse which is a disaster for us mr voskuijl was ou r greatest source of help and suppor when it came to safety measures we miss him ve ry much next month its our turn to hand over our radio to the authorit ies mr kleiman has a small set hidden in his home that hes giving us to replace our beautiful cabinet radio its a pity we have to turn in our big philips but when youre i n hiding you cant afford to bring the authorities down on your heads of course well put the baby radio upstairs whats a clandestine radio when there are al ready clandestine jews and clandestine money all over the country people are trying to get hold of an old rad io that they can hand over instead of their morale booster its true as the rep orts from outside grow worse and worse the radio with its wondrous voice helps us not to lose heart and to keep telling ourselves cheer up keep your spirits high t hings are bound to get better yours anne sunday july 11 1943 dear kitty to get back to the subject of childrearing for the umpteent h time let me tell you that im doing my best to be helpful friendly and kind and to d o all i can to keep the rain of rebukes down to a light drizzle its not easy trying t o behave like a model child with people you cant stand especially when you dont mean a word of it but i can see that a little hypocrisy gets me a lot further than myoi d method of saying exactly what i think even though no one ever asks my opinion o r cares one way or another of course i often forget my role and find it imposs ible to curb my anger when theyre unfair so that they spend the next month saying the most impertinent girl in the world dont you think im to be pitied sometimes its a good thing im not the grouchy type because then i might become sour and badte mpered i can usually see the humorous side of their scoldings but its easier whe n somebody else is being raked over the coals further ive decided after a great deal of thought to drop the shorthand first so that i have more time for my other subjects and second becau se of my eyes thats a sad story ive become very nearsighted and should have had glasses ages ago ugh wont i look like a dope but as you know people in hid ing cant yesterday all anyone here could talk about was annes eyes b ecause mother had suggested i go to the ophthalmologist with mrs kleiman jus t hearing this made my knees weak since its no small matter going outside just t hink of it walking down the street i cant imagine it i was petrified at first and t hen glad but its not as simple as all that the various authorities who had to approv e such a step were unable to reach a quick decision they first had to carefully weigh a ll the difficulties and risks though miep was ready to set off immediately with me in tow in the meantime id taken my gray coat from the closet but it was so small it lo oked as if it might have belonged to my little sister we lowered the hem but i st ill couldnt button it im really curious to see what they decide only i dont think theyll ever work out a plan because the british have landed in sicily and fathers all set for a quick finish beps been giving margot and me a lot of office work to do it ma kes us both feel important and its a big help to her anyone can file letters and make entries in a sales book but we do it with remarkable accuracy miep has so much to carry she looks like a pack mule she goes fo rth nearly every day to scrounge up vegetables and then bicycles back with he r purchases in large shopping bags shes also the one who brings five library boo ks with her every saturday we long for saturdays because that means books we re like a bunch of little kids with a present ordinary people dont know how mu ch books can mean to someone whos cooped up our only diversions are reading studying and listening to t he radio yours anne tuesday july 13 1943 the best little table yesterday afternoon father gave me permission to ask mr dus sel whether he would please be so good as to allow me see how polite i am to use the table in our room two afternoons a week from four to fivethirty i already si t there every day from twothirty to four while dussel takes a nap but the rest of th e time the room and the table are offlimits to me its impossible to study next door in the afternoon because theres too much going on besides father sometime s likes to sit at the desk during the afternoon so it seemed like a reasonable request and i asked dussel ver y politely what do you think the learned gentlemans reply was no just plain n o i was incensed and wasnt about to let myself be put off like th at i asked him the reason for his no but this didnt get me anywhere the gist of his reply was i have to study too you know and if i cant do that in the aftern oons i wont be able to fit it in at all i have to finish the task ive set for myself otherwise theres no point in starting besides you arent serious about your st udies mythology what kind of work is that reading and knitting dont count either i use that table and im not going to give it up i replied mr dussel i do take my wsork seriously i cant s tudy next door in the afternoons and i would appreciate it if you would reconside r my request having said these words the insulted anne turned around and pretended the learned doctor wasnt there i was seething with rage and felt that du ssel had been incredibly rude which he certainly had been and that id been very poli te that evening when i managed to get hold of pim i told him what had happened and we discussed what my next step should be because i had no inte ntion of giving up and preferred to deal with the matter myself pim gave me a rou gh idea of how to approach dussel but cautioned me to wait until the next day since i was in such a flap i ignored this last piece of advice and waited for dusse l after the dishes had been done pim was sitting next door and that had a calming eff ect i began mr dussel you seem to believe further discussion of the matter is pointless but i beg you to reconsider dussel gave me his most charming smile and said im always p repared to discuss the matter even though its already been settled i went on talking despite dussels repeated interruptions when you first came here i said we agreed that the room was to be shared by the two of us if we were to divide it fairly youd have the entire morning and id have t he entire afternoon im not asking for that much but two afternoons a week does seem r easonable to me dussel leapt out of his chair as if hed sat on a pin you have n o business talking about your rights to the room where am i supposed to go maybe i should ask mr van daan to build me a cubbyhole in the attic youre not the on ly one who cant find a quiet place to work youre always looking for a fight if yo ur sister margot who has more right to work space than you do had come to me with the same request id never even have thought of refusing but you and once again he brought up the business about the mythology and the knitting and once again anne was insulted however i showed no sign of it a nd let dussel finish but no its impossible to talk to you youre shamefully se lfcentered no one else matters as long as you get your way ive never seen such a chi ld but after all is said and done ill be obliged to let you have your way since i dont want people saying later on that anne frank failed her exams because mr d ussel refused to relinquish his table he went on and on until there was such a deluge of words i could h ardly keep up for one fleeting moment i thought him and his lies ill sma ck his ugly mug so hard hell go bouncing off the wall but the next moment i thought calm down hes not worth getting so upset about at long last mr dussel s fury was spent and he left the room w ith an expression of triumph mixed with wrath his coat pockets bulging with food i went running over to father and recounted the entire story or at least those parts he hadnt been able to follow himself rim decided to talk to d ussel that very same evening and they spoke for more than half an hour they first discussed whether anne should be allowed to use th e table yes or no father said that he and dussel had dealt with the subject once before at which time hed professed to agree with dussel because he didnt want to contradict the elder in front of the younger but that even then he hadnt thought i t was fair dussel felt i had no right to talk as if he were an intruder laying claim to ev erything in sight but father protested strongly since he himself had heard me say nothing of the kind and so the conversation went back and forth with father defendi ng my selfishness and my busywork and dussel grumbling the whole time dussel finally had to give in and i was granted the opportuni ty to work without interruption two afternoons a week dussel looked very sull en didnt speak to me for two days and made sure he occupied the table from five to five thirty all very childish of course anyone whos so petty and pedantic at the age of fiftyfour wa s born that way and is never going to change friday july 16 1943 dearest kitty theres been another breakin but this time a real one pete r went down to the warehouse this morning at seven as usual and noticed at onc e that both the warehouse door and the street door were open he immediately reported this to pim who went to the private office tuned the radio to a german sta tion and locked the door then they both went back upstairs in such cases our ord ers are not to wash ourselves or run any water to be quiet to be dressed by eight and not to go to the bathroom and as usual we followed these to the letter we we re all glad wed slept so well and hadnt heard anything for a while we were indigna nt because no one from the office came upstairs the entire morning mr kleiman lef t us on tenterhooks until eleventhirty he told that the burglars had forced the outs ide door and the warehouse door with a crowbar but when they didnt find anything worth stealing they tried their luck on the next floor they stole two cashboxes contai ning 40 guilders blank checkbooks and worst of all coupons for 330 pounds of sugar our entire allotment it wont be easy to wangle new ones mr kugler thinks this burglar belongs to the same gang as the one who made an unsuccessful attempt six weeks ago to open all three doors t he warehouse door and the two outside doors the burglary caused another stir but the annex seems to thri ve on excitement naturally we were glad the cash register and the typewriter s had been safely tucked away in our clothes closet yours anne ps landing in sicily another step closer to the monday july 191943 dearest kitty north amsterdam was very heavily bombed on sunday there was apparently a great deal of destruction entire streets are in ruins and it will take a while for them to dig out all the bodies so far there have been two hundred dead and countless wounded the hospitals are bursting at the seams weve been told of ch ildren searching forlornly in the smoldering ruins for their dead parents it still make s me shiver to think of the dull distant drone that signified the approaching destruc tion friday july 23 1943 bep is currently able to get hold of notebooks especially jo urnals and ledgers useful for my bookkeeping sister other kinds are for sale as well b ut dont ask what theyre like or how long theyll last at the moment theyre all labe led no coupons needed like everything else you can purchase without rati on stamps theyre i totally worthless they consist of twelve sheets of gray i paper with narrow lines that slant across the page margot is thinking about taking a course in c alligraphy ive advised her to go ahead and do it mother wont let me because of my eyes but i think thats silly whether i do i that or something else it all comes down to the same i thing since youve never been through a war kitty and since you kn ow very little about life in hiding in spite of my letters let me tell you just fo r fun what we each want to do first when were able to go outside again margot and mr van daan wish above all else to have a hot bath filled to the brim which they can lie in for more than half an hour mrs van daan w ould like a cake dussel can think of nothing but seeing his charlotte and mot her is dying for a cup of real coffee father would like to visit mr voskuijl peter w ould go downtown and as for me id be so overjoyed i wouldnt know where to begin most of all i long to have a home of our own to be able to move aro und freely and have someone help me with my homework again at last in other words to go back to school bep has offered to get us some fruit at socalled bargain pri ces grapes 250 guilders a pound gooseberries 70 cents a pound one peach 50 cents me lons 75 cents a pound no wonder the papers write every evening in big fat le tters keep prices down monday july 26 1943 dear kitty yesterday was a very tumultuous day and were still all woun d up actually you may wonder if theres ever a day that passes without some kind of e xcitement the first warning siren went off in the morning while we were a t breakfast but we paid no attention because it only meant that the planes were crossing the coast i had a terrible headache so i lay down for an hour after breakfast and then went to the office at around two at twothirty margot had finished her office work and was jus t gathering her things together when the sirens began wailing again so she and i tro oped back upstairs none too soon it seems for less than five minutes later the g uns were booming so loudly that we went and stood in the hall the house shook and t he bombs kept falling i was clutching my escape bag more because i want ed to have something to hold on to than because i wanted to run away i know we cant lea ve here but if we had to being seen on the streets would be just as dangerous as getting caught in an air raid after half an hour the drone of engines faded and the house began to hum with activity again peter emerged from his lookout post in t he front attic dussel remained in the front office mrs van d felt safest in the pr ivate office mr van daan had been watching from the loft and those of us on the lan ding spread out to watch the columns of smoke rising from the harbor before lon g the smell of fire was everywhere and outside it looked as if the city were envelop ed in a thick fog a big fire like that is not a pleasant sight but fortunately f or us it was all over and we went back to our various chores just as we were starting di nner another airraid alarm the food was good but i lost my appetite the moment i he ard the siren nothing happened however and fortyfive minutes later th e all clear was sounded after the dishes had been washed another airraid warning gunfire and swarms of planes oh gosh twice in one day we thought thats twi ce in one day we thought thats twice too many little good that did us be cause once agai the bombs rained down this time on the others of the city according to british reports schiphol airport was bombed the planes dived and climbed the air was abuzz with the drone of engines it was very scary and the whole time i kept thinki ng here it comes this is it i can assure you that when i went to bed at nine my legs were sti ll shaking at the stroke of midnight i woke up again more planes dussel was un dressing but i took no notice and leapt up wide awake at the sound of the first sh ot i stayed in fathers bed until one in my own bed until onethirty and was back in f athers bed at two but the planes kept on coming at last they stopped firing and i was able to go back home again i finally fell asleep at half past two seven oclock i awoke with a start and sat up in bed mr van da an was with father my first thought was burglars everything i heard mr va n daan say and i thought everything had been stolen but no this time it was wonderfu l news the best weve had in months maybe even since the war began mussolini has r esigned and the king of italy has taken over the government we jumped for joy after the awful events of yesterday final ly something good happens and brings us hope hope for an end to the war hope for peace mr kugler dropped by and told us that the fokker aircraft fac tory had been hit hard meanwhile there was another airraid alarm this morning w ith planes flying over and another warning siren ive had it up to here with alarms iv e hardly slept and the last thing i want to do is work but now the suspense about ital y and the hope that the war will be over by the end of the year are keeping us awake yours anne thursday july 29 1943 dearest kitty mrs van daan dussel and i were doing the dishes and i was ext remely quiet this is very unusual for me and they were sure to notice so in order to avoid any questions i quickly racked my brains for a neutral topic i t hought the book henry from across the street might fit the bill but i couldnt have been more wrong if mrs van daan doesnt jump down my throat mr dussel does it all b oiled down to this mr dussel had recommended the book to margot and me as an exam ple of excellent writing we thought it was anything but that the little boy h ad been portrayed well but as for the rest the less said the better i mentioned so mething to that effect while we were doing the dishes and dussel launched into a ver itable tirade how can you possibly understand the psychology of a man tha t of a child isnt so difficult but youre far too young to read a book like tha t even a twentyyearold man would be unable to comprehend it so w hy did he go out of his way to recommend it to margot and me mrs van d and dussel continued their harangue you know wa y too much about things youre not supposed to youve been brought up all wro ng later on when youre older you wont be able to enjoy anything anymore yo ull say oh i read that twenty years ago in some book youd better hurry if you want to catch a husband or fall in love since everything is bound to be a disappointmen t to you you already know all there is to know in theory but in practice thats an other story can you imagine how i felt i astonished myself by calmly repl ying you may think i havent been raised properly but many people would disagre e they apparently believe that good childrearing includes t rying to pit me against my parents since thats all they ever do and not telling a girl my age about grownup subjects is fine we can all see what happens when people are raised that way at that moment i could have slapped them both for poking fun at me i was beside myself with rage and if i only knew how much longer we had to pu t up with each others company id start counting the days mrs van daans a fine one to talk she sets an example all righ t a bad one shes known to be exceedingly pushy egotistical cunning calculating and perpetually dissatisfied add to that vanity and coquettishness and th eres no question about it shes a thoroughly despicable person i could write an entir e book about madame van daan and who knows maybe someday i will anyone can put on a c harming exterior when they want to mrs van d is friendly to strangers espec ially men so its easy to make a mistake when you first get to know her mother thinks that mrs van d is too stupid for words margot that shes too unimportant pim that shes too ugly literally and figurat ively and after long observation im never prejudiced at the beginning ive c ome to the conclusion that shes all three of the above and lots more besides she has so many bad traits why should i single out just one of them yours anne ps will the reader please take into consideration that thi s story was written before the writers fury had cooled tuesday august 3 1943 dearest kitty things are going well on the political front italy has banne d the fascist party the people are fighting the fascists in many places even the ar my has joined the fight how can a country like that continue to wage war agains t england our beautiful radio was taken away last week dussel was very angry at mr kugler for turning it in on the appointed day dussel is slipping low er and lower in my estimation and hes already below zero hatever he says abo ut politics history geography or ything else is so ridiculous that i hardly dare r epeat it hitler will fade from history the harbor in rotterdam is bigger than the one i n hamburg the english are idiots for not taking the opportunity to bomb italy to smi thereens etc etc we just had a third air raid i decided to grit my teeth and prac tice being courageous mrs van daan the one who always said let them fall and bet ter to end with a bang than not to end at all is the most cowardly one among us she was shaking like a leaf this morning and even burst into tears she was comfort ed by her husband with whom she recently declared a truce after a week of squabbling i nearly got sentimental at the sight mouschi has now proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that havin g a cat has disadvantages as well as advantages the whole house is craw ling with fleas and its getting worse each day mr kleiman sprinkled yellow powder in every nook and cranny but the fleas havent taken the slightest notice it s making us all very jittery were forever imagining a bite on our arms and legs or other pa rts of our bodies so we leap up and do a few exercises since it gives us an excuse to take a better look at our arms or necks but now were paying the price for having had so little physical exercise were so stiff we can hardly turn our heads the rea l calisthenics fell by the wayside long ago yours anne wednesday august 41943 dearest kitty now that weve been in hiding for a little over a year you know a great deal about our lives still i cant possibly tell you everything sinc e its all so different compared to ordinary times and ordinary people nevertheless to giv e you a closer look into our lives from time to time ill describe part of an ordinary day ill start with the evening and night nine in the evening bedtime always begins in the annex with a n enormous hustle and bustle chairs are shifted beds pulled out blankets unfol ded nothing stays where it is during the daytime i sleep on a small divan which is onl y five feet long so we have to add a few chairs to make it longer comforter sheets pillows blankets everything has to be removed from dussel s bed where its ke pt during the day in the next room theres a terrible creaking thats margot s folding bed being set up more blankets and pillows anything to make the wooden slats a bit more comfortable upstairs it sounds like thunder but its only mrs van ds b ed being shoved against the window so that her majesty arrayed in her pink bed jacket can sniff the night air through her delicate little nostrils nine oclock after peters finished its my turn for the ba throom i wash myself from head to toe and more often than not i find a tiny flea floating in the sink only during the hot months weeks or days i brush my teeth curl m y hair manicure my nails and dab peroxide on my upper lip to bleach the black hair s all this in less than half an hour ninethirty i throw on my bathrobe with soap in one hand an d potty hairpins panties curlers and a wad of cotton in the other i hurry out o f the bathroom the next in line invariably calls me back to remove the gracefull y curved but unsightly hairs that ive left in the sink ten oclock time to put up the blackout screen and say goodn ight for the next fifteen minutes at least the house is filled with the creak ing of beds and the sigh of broken springs and then provided our upstairs neighbors a rent having a marital spat in bed all is quiet eleventhirty the bathroom door creaks a narrow strip of l ight falls into the room squeaking shoes a large coat even larger than the man insid e it dussel is returning from his nightly work in mr kuglers office i hea r him shuffiing back and forth for ten whole minutes the rustle of paper from the foo d hes tucking away in his cupboard and the bed being made up then the figure disap pears again and the only sound is the occasional suspicious noise from the bathr oom approximately three oclock i have to get up to use the tin ca n under my bed which to be on the safe side has a rubber mat underneath in case of le aks i always hold my breath while i go since it clatters into the can like a broo k down a mountainside the potty is returned to its place and the figure in the white nightgown the one that causes margot to exclaim every evening oh that indecent n ighty climbs back into bed a certain somebody lies awake for about fifteen minutes listening to the sounds of the night in the first place to hear whether there are any burglars downstairs and then to the various beds upstairs next door and in my room to tell whether the others are asleep or half awake this is no fun especiall y when it concerns a member of the family named dr dussel first theres the sou nd of a fish gasping for air and this is repeated nine or ten times then the lips are moistened profusely this is alternated with little smacking sounds followed by a long period of tossing and turning and rearranging the pillows after five minutes of p erfect quiet the same sequence repeats itself three more times after which hes p resumably lulled himself back to sleep for a while sometimes the guns go off during the night between one and fo ur im never aware of it before it happens but all of a sudden i find myself standin g beside my bed out of sheer habit occasionally im dreaming so deeply of irregu lar french verbs or a quarrel upstairs that i realize only when my dream is over th at the shooting has stopped and that ive remained quietly in my room but usuall y i wake up then i grab a pillow and a handkerchief throw on my robe and slipper s and dash next door to father just the way margot described in this birthday poe m when shots rino out in the dark of night the door creaks open and into sight come a hanky a pillow a figure in white once ive reached the big bed the worst is over except when t he shooting is extra loud six fortyfive brrring the alarm clock which raises it s shrill voice at any hour of the day or night whether you want it to or not creak wha m mrs van d turns it off screak mr van d gets up puts on the water an d races to the bathroom sevenfifteen the door creaks again dussel can go to the ba throom alone at last i remove the blackout screen and a new day begins in the anne x yours anne thursday august 5 1943 dearest kitty today lets talk about the lunch break its twelvethirty the whole gang breathes a sigh of relief mr van maaren the man with the shady past and mr de kok have gone home for lunch upstairs you can hear the thud of the vacuum cleaner on mrs va n ds beautiful and only rug margot tucks a few books under her arm and heads for t he class for slow learners which is what dussel seems to be pim goes and sits in a corner with his constant companion dickens in hopes of finding a bit of pea ce and quiet mother hastens upstairs to help the busy little housewife and i tid y up both the bathroom and myself at the same time twelve fortyfive one by one they trickle in first mr gies and then either mr kleiman or mr kugler followed by be p and sometimes even miep one clustered around the radio they all listen raptly to th e bbc this is the only time the members of the annex family dont interrupt each oth er since even mr van daan cant argue with the speaker onefifteen food distribution everyone from downstairs gets a cup of soup plus dessert if there happens to be any a contented mr gies sits on the divan or leans against the desk with his newspaper cup and usually the cat a t his side if one of the three is missing he doesnt hesitate to let his protest be he ard mr kleiman relates the latest news from town and hes an excellent source mr k ugler hurries up the stairs gives a short but solid knock on the door and comes in e ither wringing his hands or rubbing them in glee depending on whether hes quie t and in a bad mood or talkative and in a good mood one fortyfive everyone rises from the table and goes about their business margot and mother do the dishes mr and mrs van d head for the divan peter for the attic father for his divan dussel too and anne does her homework what comes next is the quietest hour of the day when theyre a ll asleep there are no disturbances to judge by his face dussel is dreaming of f ood but i dont look at him long because the time whizzes by and before you know it i tll be 4 pm and the pedantic dr dussel will be standing with the clock in his han d because im one minute late clearing off the table yours anne saturday august 7 1943 dearest kitty a few weeks ago i started writing a story something i made up f rom beginning to end and ive enjoyed it so much that the products of my pen are piling up yours anne monday august 9 1943 dearest kitty we now continue with a typical day in the annex since weve al ready had lunch its time to describe dinner mr van daan is served first and takes a generous portion of whatever he likes usually joins in the conversation never fails to give his op inion once hes spoken his word is final if anyone dares to suggest otherwise mr van d can put up a good fight oh he can hiss like a cat but id rather he didnt o nce youve seen it you never want to see it again his opinion is the best he knows th e most about everything granted the man has a good head on his shoulders but its swelled to no small degree madame actually the best thing would be to say nothing som e days especially when a foul mood is on the way her face is hard to read if you analyz e the discussions you realize shes not the subject but the guilty party a fac t everyone prefers to ignore even so you could call her the instigator stirring up trouble now thats what mrs van daan calls fun stirring up trouble between mrs fra nk and anne margot and mr frank aren t qwte as easy but lets return to the table mrs van d may think she doesn t always get enough but thats not the case the choicest potatoes the tastiest morsel the tenderest bit of whatever there is thats madames motto the others can all have their turn as long as i get the best exactly what she accuses anne frank of doin g her second watchword is keep talking as long as somebodys listening it doesnt seem to occur to her to wonder whether theyre interested she must think t hat whatever mrs van daan says will interest everyone smile coquettishly pretend you know everything offer eve ryone a piece of advice and mother them thats sure to make a good impression but if yo u take a better look the good impression fades one shes hardworking two che erful three coquettish and sometimes a cute face thats petronella van daan the third diner says very little young mr van daan is usual ly quiet and hardly makes his presence known as far as his appetite is concerned hes a danaldean vessel that never gets full even after the most substantial meal he can look you calmly in the eye and claim he could have eaten twice as much number four margot eats like a bird and doesnt talk at all she eats only vegetables and fruit spoiled in the opinion of the van da ans too little exercise and fresh air in ours beside her mama has a hearty appetite does her share of th e talking no one has the impression as they do with mrs van daan that this is a housewife whats the difference between the two well mrs van d does the coo king and mother does the dishes and polishes the furniture numbers six and seven i wont say much about father and me th e former is the most modest person at the table he always looks to see whethe r the others have been served first he needs nothing for himself the best thi ngs are for the children hes goodness personified seated next to him is the annexs little bundle of nerves dussel help yourself keep your eyes on the food eat and don t talk and if you have to say something then for goodness sake talk about food th at doesnt lead to quarrels just to bragging he consumes enormous portions and no is not part of his vocabulary whether the food is good or bad pants that come up to his chest a red jacket black patentle ather slippers and hornrimmed glasses thats how he looks when hes at work a t the little table always studying and never progressing this is interrupted only by his afternoon nap food and his favorite spot the bathroom three four or f ive times a day theres bound to be someone waiting outside the bathroom doo r hopping impatiently from one foot to another trying to hold it in and barely manag ing does dussel care not a whit from sevenfifteen to seventhirty from twelve thirty to one from two to twofifteen from four to fourfifteen from six to sixf ifteen from eleventhirty to twelve you can set your watch by them these are the times f or his regular sessions he never deviates or lets himself be swayed by the voices outside the door begging him to open up before a disaster occurs number nine is not part of our annex family although she does share our house and table hep has a healthy appetite she cleans her plate and is nt choosy heps easy to please and that pleases us she can be characterized as follo ws cheerful goodhumored kind and willing tuesday august 10 1943 dearest kitty a new idea during meals i talk more to myself than to the other s which has two advantages first theyre glad they dont have to listen to my continuous chatter and second i dont have to get annoyed by their opinions i dont think my opinions are stupid but other people do so its better to keep them to myse lf i apply the same tactic when i have to eat something i loathe i put the dish in f ront of me pretend its delicious avoid looking at it as much as possible and i ts gone before ive had time to realize what it is when i get up in the morning anothe r very disagreeable moment i leap out of bed think to myself youll be slippin g back under the covers soon walk to the window take down the blackout screen sni ff at the crack until i feel a bit of fresh air and im awake i strip the bed as fast as i can so i wont be tempted to get back in do you know what mother calls this sort of thing the art of living isnt that a funny expression weve all been a little confused this past week because our de arly beloved westertoren bells have been carted off to be melted down for t he war so we have no idea of the exact time either night or day i still have hopes that theyll come up with a substitute made of tin or copper or some such thing to remi nd the neighborhood of the clock everywhere i go upstairs or down they all cast admiring gla nces at my feet which are adorned by a pair of exceptionally beautiful for times l ike these shoes miep managed to snap them up for 2750 guilders burgundycolore d suede and leather with mediumsized high heels i feel as if i were on stilts and loo k even taller than i already am yesterday was my unlucky day i pricked my right thumb with th e blunt end of a big needle as a result margot had to peel potatoes for me take t he good with the bad and writing was awkward then i bumped into the cupboard door so hard it nearly knocked me over and was scolded for making such a racket the y wouldnt let me run water to bathe my forehead so now im walking around with a gi ant lump over my right eye to make matters worse the little toe on my right fo ot got stuck in the vacuum cleaner it bled and hurt but my other ailments were a lready causing me so much trouble that i let this one slide which was stupid of me because now im walking around with an infected toe what with the salve the gauze and the tape i cant get my heavenly new shoe on my foot dussel has put us in danger for the umpteenth time he actuall y had miep bring him a book an antimussolini tirade which has been banned on th e way here she was knocked down by an ss motorcycle she lost her head and shoute d you brutes and went on her way i dont dare think what would have happened if shed been taken down to headquarters yours anne a daily chore in our little community peeling potatoes one person goes to get some newspapers another the knives keeping the best for himself of course the third the potatoes and the fourth the water mr dussel begins he may not always peel them very well but h e does peel nonstop glancing left and right to see if everyone is doing it the way h e does no theyre not look anne i am taking peeler in my hand like so and going fro m the top to bottom nein not so but so i think my way is easier mr dussel i say tentatively but this is best way anne this you can take from me of cours e it is no matter you do the way you want we go on peeling i glance at dussel out of the corner of my eye lost in thought he shakes his head over me no doubt but says no more i keep on peeling then i look at father on the other side of me to father peeling potatoes is not a chore but precision work when he reads he has a deep wrinkle in the back of his head but when hes preparing potatoes beans or vegetables he seems to be totally absorbed in his task he puts on his potatopeel ing face and when its set in that particular way it would be impossible for him to t urn out anything less than a perfectly peeled potato i keep on working i glance up for a second but thats all the t ime i need mrs van d is trying to attract dussels attention she starts by loo king in his direction but dussel pretends not to notice she winks but dussel goes on p eeling she laughs but dussel still doesnt look up then mother laughs too but dus sel pays them no mind having failed to achieve her goal mrs van d is obliged to ch ange tactics theres a brief silence then she says putti why dont you put on an a pron otherwise ill have to spend all day tomorrow trying to get the spots out of yo ur suit im not getting it dirty another brief silence putti why dont you sit down im fine this way i like standing up silence putti look out du spritzt schon now youre splashi ng i know mommy but im being careful mrs van d casts about for another topic tell me putti wh y arent the british carrying out any bombing raids today because the weathers bad kerli but yesterday it was such nice weather and they werent flyi ng then either lets drop the subject why cant a person talk about that or offer an opinion well why in the world not oh be quiet mammichen mommy mr frank always answers his wife mr van d is trying to control himself this remark always ru bs him the wrong way but mrs van ds not one to quit oh theres never going to b e an invasion mr van d turns white and when she notices it mrs van d tur ns red but shes not about to be deterred the british arent doing a thing the bomb bursts and now shut up donnerwetter noch mal for crying out loud mother can barely stifle a laugh and i stare straight ahead scenes like these are repeated almost daily unless theyve just had a terrible fight in that case neither mr nor mrs van d says a word its time for me to get some more potatoes i go up to the attic where peter is busy picking fleas from the cat he looks up the cat notices it and whoosh hes gone out t he window and into the rain gutter peter swears i laugh and slip out of the room freedom in the annex fivethirty beps arrival signals the beginning of our nig htly freedom things get going right away i go upstairs with bep who usually has her d essert before the rest of us the moment she sits down mrs van d begins stating her wishes her list usually starts with oh by the way bep something else id l ike bep winks at me mrs van d doesnt miss a chance to make her wishes known t o whoever comes upstairs it must be one of the reasons none of them like to go u p there five fortyfive bep leaves i go down two floors to have a loo k around first to the kitchen then to the private office and then to the coal bin to open the cat door for mouschi after a long tour of inspection i wind up in mr kuglers offi ce mr van daan is combing all the drawers and files for todays mail peter pic ks up boche and the warehouse key pim lugs the typewriters upstairs margot lo oks around for a quiet place to do her office work mrs van d puts a kettle of water o n the stove mother comes down the stairs with a pan of potatoes we all know our jo bs soon peter comes back from the warehouse the first question they ask him is whether hes remembered the bread no he hasnt he crouche s before the door to the front office to make himself as small as possible and crawls o n his hands and knees to the steel cabinet takes out the bread and starts to leave at any rate thats what he intends to do but before he knows whats happened mouschi h as jumped over him and gone to sit under the desk peter looks all around him aha theres the cat he crawls ba ck into the office and grabs the cat by the tail mouschi hisses peter sighs what h as he accomplished mouschis now sitting by the window licking herself very pl eased at having escaped peters clutches peter has no choice but to lure her with a pi ece of bread mouschi takes the bait follows him out and the door closes i watch the entire scene through a crack in the door mr van daan is angry and slams the door margot and i exchange looks and think the same thing he must have worked himself into a rage again beca use of some blunder on mr kuglers part and hes forgotten all about the keg com pany next door another step is heard in the hallway dussel comes in goes to ward the window with an air of propriety sniffs coughs sneezes and clears hi s throat hes out of luck it was pepper he continues on to the front office the curt ains are open which means he cant get at his writing paper he disappears with a s cowl margot and i exchange another glance one less page for his s weetheart tomorrow i hear her say i nod in agreement an elephants tread is heard on the stairway its dussel se eking comfort in his favorite spot we

hair put away the potty shove the bed back in place quiet the clock is str iking eightthirty mrs van d changes shoes and shuffles through the room in her slip pers mr van d too a veritable charlie chaplin all is quiet the ideal family scene has now reached its high point i want t o read or study and margot does too father and mother ditto father is sitting with dickens and the dictionary of course on the edge of the sagging squeaky be d which doesnt even have a decent mattress two bolsters can be piled on top of eac h other i dont need these he thinks i can manage without them once he starts reading he doesnt look up he laughs now and t hen and tries to get mother to read a story i dont have the time right now he looks disappointed but then continues to read a little while later when he comes across another good passa ge he tries again you have to read this mother mother sits on the folding bed either reading sewing knit ting or studying whichever is next on her list an idea suddenly occurs to her and she qui ckly says so as not to forget anne remember to margot jot this down after a while its quiet again margot slams her book shut fa ther knits his forehead his eyebrows forming a funny curve and his wrinkle of concent ration reappearing i at the back of his head and he buries himself in his book 1 again mother starts chatting with margot and i get curious and listen too pim is drawn int o the conversation nine oclock breakfast friday september 10 1943 dearest kitty every time i write to you something special has happened us ually unpleasant rather than pleasant this time however something wonderful is g oing on on wednesday september 8 we were listening to the seven oc lock news when we heard an announcement here is some of the best news of the wa r so far italy has capitulated italy has unconditionally surrendered the dutch broadcast from england began at eightfifteen with the news listeners an hour an d fifteen minutes ago just as i finished writing my daily report we received the wonder ful news of italys capitulation i tell you i never tossed my notes into the was tepaper basket with more delight than i did today god save the king the american national anthem and the rus sian internationale were played as always the dutch program was uplifting with out being too optimistic the british have landed in naples northern italy is occupie d by the germans the truce was signed on friday september 3 the day the british l anded in italy the germans are ranting and raving in all the newspapers at the tr eachery of badoglio and the italian king still theres bad news as well its about mr kleiman as yo u know we all like him very much hes unfailingly cheerful and amazingly brave d espite the fact that hes always sick and in pain and cant eat much or do a lot of walking when mr kleiman enters a room the sun begins to shine mother said recently and shes absolutely right now it seems he has to go to the hospital for a very difficult op eration on his stomach and will have to stay there for at least four weeks y ou should have seen him when he told us goodbye he acted so normally as though h e were just off to do an errand yours anne thursday september 16 1943 dearest kitty relationships here in the annex are getting worse all the tim e we dont dare open our mouths at mealtime except to slip in a bite of food beca use no matter what we say someone is bound to resent it or take it the wrong way mr voskuijl occasionally comes to visit us unfortunately hes not doing very well h e isnt making it any easier for his family because his attitude seems to be what do i care im going to die anyway when i think how touchy everyone is here i can jus t imagine what it must be like at the voskuijls ive been taking valerian every day to fight the anxiety and d epression but it doesnt stop me from being even more miserable the next day a good hea rty laugh would help better than ten valerian drops but weve almost forgot ten how to laugh sometimes im afraid my face is going to sag with all this sorr ow and that my mouth is going to permanently droop at the corners the others aren t doing any better everyone here is dreading the great terror known as winter another fact that doesnt exactly brighten up our days is tha t mr van maaren the man who works in the warehouse is getting suspicious about t he annex a person with any brains must have noticed by now that miep sometimes s ays shes going to the lab bep to the file room and mr kleiman to the opekta supp lies while mr kugler claims the annex doesnt belong to this building at al l but to the one next door we wouldnt care what mr van maaren thought of the situation except that hes known to be unreliable and to possess a high degree of curiosi ty hes not one who can be put off with a flimsy excuse one day mr kugler wanted to be extra cautious so at twenty pa st twelve he put on his coat and went to the drugstore around the corner less tha n five minutes later he was back and he sneaked up the stairs like a thief to visit us at onefifteen he started to leave but bep met him on the landing and warned him that van maaren was in the office mr kugler did an aboutface and stayed with us until onethirty then he took off his shoes and went in his stockinged feet despite his cold to the front attic and down the other stairway taking one step at a time to avoid the creaks it took him fifteen minutes to negotiate the stairs but he woun d up safely in the office after having entered from the outside in the meantime bep had gotten rid of van maaren and come to ge t mr kugler from the annex but hed already left and at that moment was still t iptoeing down the stairs what must the passersby have thought when they saw th e manager putting on his shoes outside hey you there in the socks yours anne wednesday september 29 1943 dearest kitty its mrs van daans birthday other than one ration stamp ea ch for cheese meat and bread all she received from us was a jar of jam her husband d ussel and the office staff gave her nothing but flowers and also food such are the times we live in bep had a nervous fit last week because she had so many errands to do ten times a day people were sending her out for something each time insi sting she go right away or go again or that shed done it all wrong and when you think t hat she has her regular office work to do that mr kleiman is sick that miep is home with a cold and that bep herself has a sprained ankle boyfriend troubles an d a grouchy father its no wonder shes at the end of her tether we comforted her and tol d her that if shed put her foot down once or twice and say she didnt have the time th e shopping lists would shrink of their own accord saturday there was a big drama the likes of which have never b een seen here before it started with a discussion of van maaren and ended in a gener al argument and tears dussel complained to mother that he was being treated like a l eper that no one was friendly to him and that after all he hadnt done anything t o deserve it this was followed by a lot of sweet talk which luckily mother didnt f all for this time she told him we were disappointed in him and that on more than one occa sion hed been a source of great annoyance dussel promised her the moon but as usual we havent seen so much as a beam theres trouble brewing with the van daans i can tell fathe rs furious because theyre cheating us theyve been holding back meat and othe r things oh what kind of bombshell is about to burst now if only i werent so involved in all these skirmishes if only i could leave here theyre driving us crazy yours anne sunday october 17 1943 dearest kitty mr kleiman is back thank goodness he looks a bit pale and y et he cheerfully set off to sell some clothes for mr van daan the disagreeable fa ct is that mr van daan has run out of money he lost his last hundred guilders in the w arehouse which is still creating trouble for us the men are wondering how a hun dred guilders could wind up in the warehouse on a monday morning suspicion abounds m eanwhile the hundred guilders have been stolen whos the thief but i was talking about the money shortage mrs van d has sca ds of dresses coats and shoes none of which she feels she can do without mr van d s suit is difficult to sell and peters bike was put on the block but is back again since nobody wanted it but the story doesnt end there you see mrs van d is going t o have to part with her fur coat in her opinion the firm should pay for our upkee p but thats ridiculous they just had a flaming row about it and have entered the oh m y sweet putti and darling kerli stage of reconciliation my mind boggles at the profanity this honorable house has had to endure in the past month father walks

blot ched with red margot complains of headaches dussel cant sleep mrs van d fret s and fumes all day long and ive gone completely round the bend to tell you the truth i sometimes forget who were at odds with and who were not the only way to take my mind off it is to study and ive been doing a lot of that lately yours anne friday october 291943 my dearest kitty mr kleiman is out again his stomach wont give him a moment s peace he doesnt even know whether its stopped bleeding he came to tell us he wasnt feeling well and was going home and for the first time he seemed really dow n mr and mrs van d have had more raging battles the reason is simple theyre broke they wanted to sell an overcoat and a suit of mr van d s but were unable to find any buyers his prices were way too high some time ago mr kleiman was talking about a furrier he knows this gave mr van d the idea of selling his wifes fur coat its made of rabbit skin and shes had it for seventeen years mrs van d got 325 guilders for it an enorm ous amount she wanted to keep the money herself to buy new clothes after the war and it took some doing before mr van d could make her understand that it was desper ately needed to cover household expenses you cant imagine the screaming shouting stamping of feet and swearing that went on it was terrifying my family stood holding its breath at the b ottom of the stairs in case it might be necessary to drag them apart all the bickeri ng tears and nervous tension have become such a stress and strain that i fall into m y bed at night crying and thanking my lucky stars that i have half an hour to myself im doing fine except ive got no appetite i keep hearing goodness you look awful i must admit theyre doing their best to keep me in con dition theyre plying me with dextrose codliver oil brewers yeast and calcium my nerves often get the better of me especially on sundays thats when i really fee l miserable the atmosphere is stifling sluggish leaden outside you don t hear a single bird and a deathly oppressive silence hangs over the house and clings to me as if it were going to drag me into the deepest regions of the underworld at time s like these father mother and margot dont matter to me in the least i wander fro m room to room climb up and down the stairs and feel like a songbird whose win gs have been ripped off and who keeps hurling itself against the bars of its dark c age let me out where theres fresh air and laughter a voice within me cries i do nt even bother to reply anymore but lie down on the divan sleep makes the silence an d the terrible fear go by more quickly helps pass the time since its impossible t o kill it yours anne wednesday november 3 1943 dearest kitty to take our minds off matters as well as to develop them fathe r ordered a catalog from a correspondence school margot pored through the thic k brochure three times without finding anything to her liking and within her budget father was easier to satisfy and decided to write and ask for a trial lesson in ele mentary latin no sooner said than done the lesson arrived margot set to work enthusiastically and decided to take the course despite the expense its much to o hard for me though id really like to learn latin to give me a new project as well father asked mr kleiman for a childrens bible so i could finally learn something about the new testament are you planning to give anne a bible for hanukkah margot a sked somewhat perturbed yes well maybe st nicholas day would be a better occasi on father replied jesus and hanukkah dont exactly go together since the vacuum cleaners broken i have to take an old brush to the rug every night the windows closed the lights on the stoves burning an d there i am brushing away at the rug thats sure to be a problem i thought to myself t he first time therere bound to be complaints i was right mother got a headache fr om the thick clouds of dust whirling around the room margots new latin dictionar y was caked with dirt and rim grumbled that the floor didnt look any different anyway small thanks for my pains weve decided that from now on the stove is going to be lit at se venthirty on sunday mornings instead of fivethirty i think its risky what will the neighbors think of our smoking chimney its the same with the curtains ever since we first went into hiding theyve been tacked firmly to the windows sometimes one of the ladies or g entlemen cant resist the urge to peek outside the result a storm of reproaches t he response oh nobody will notice thats how every act of carelessness be gins and ends no one will notice no one will hear no one will pay the least bit of a ttention easy to say but is it true at the moment the tempestuous quarrels have subsided only dussel and the van daans are still at loggerheads when dussel is talking about mrs van d he invariably calls her that old bat or that stupid hag and conversel y mrs van d refers to our ever so learned gentleman as an old maid or a touchy neurot ic spinster etc the pot calling the kettle black yours anne monday evening november 81943 dearest kitty if you were to read all my letters in one sitting youd be stru ck by the fact that they were written in a variety of moods it annoys me to be so depend ent on the moods here in the annex but im not the only one were all subject t o them if im engrossed in a book i have to rearrange my thoughts before i c an mingle with other people because otherwise they might think i was strange as you can see im currently in the middle of a depression i couldnt really te ll you what set it off but i think it stems from my cowardice which confronts me at every turn this evening when bep was still here the doorbell rang long and loud i ins tantly turned white my stomach churned and my heart beat wildly and all because i was afraid at night in bed i see myself alone in a dungeon without father and mother or im roaming the streets or the annex is on fire or they come in th e middle of the night to take us away and i crawl under my bed in desperation i see ev erything as if it were actually taking place and to think it might all happen s oon miep often says she envies us because we have such peace and qu iet here that may be true but shes obviously not thinking about our fear i simply cant imagine the world will ever be normal again for us i do talk about after the war but its as if i were talking about a castle in the air something that can ii never come true i see the ei ght of us in the annex as if we were a patch of blue sky surrounded by menacing black clouds the perfectly round spot on which we re standing is still safe but the clouds are moving in on us and the ring between us and t he approaching danger is being pulled tighter and tighter were surrounde d by darkness and danger and in our desperate search for a way out we keep bumping into e ach other we look at the fighting down below and the peace and beauty up above i n the meantime weve been cut off by the dark mass of clouds so that we can go n either up nor down it looms before us like an impenetrable wall trying to crush us but not yet able to i can only cry out and implore oh ring ring open w ide and let us out yours anne thursday november 11 1943 dearest kitty i have a good title for this chapter ode to my fountain pen in memoriam my fountain pen was always one of my most prized possessions i valued it highly especially because it had a thick nib and i can only write nea tly with thick nibs it has led a long and interesting fountainpen life which i wil l summarize below when i was nine my fountain pen packed in cotton arrived as a sample of no commercial value all the way from aachen where my grandmot her the kindly donor used to live i lay in bed with the flu while the february wind s howled around the apartment house this splendid fountain pen came in a red lea ther case and i showed it to my girlfriends the first chance i got me anne frank th e proud owner of a fountain pen when i was ten i was allowed to take the pen to school and to my surprise the teacher even let me write with it when i was eleven however my treasure had to be tucked away again because my sixthgrade teacher allowe d us to use only school pens and inkpots when i was twelve i started at the jewish ly ceum and my fountain pen was given a new case in honor of the occasion not only did i t have room for a pencil it also had a zipper which was much more impressive when i was thirteen the fountain pen went with me to the annex and together weve raced through countless diaries and compositions id turned fourteen an d my fountain pen was enjoying the last year of its life with me when it was just after five on friday afternoon i came out of my roo m and was about to sit down at the table to write when i was roughly pushed to one s ide to make room for margot and father who wanted to practice their latin th e fountain pen remained unused on the table while its owner sighing was forced to m ake do with a very tiny corner of the table where she began rubbing beans thats ho w we remove mold from the beans and restore them to their original state at a quart er to six i swept the floor dumped the dirt into a news paper along with the rotte n beans and tossed it into the stove a giant flame shot up and i thought it was wond erful that the stove which had been gasping its last breath had made such a miracu lous recovery all was quiet again the latin students had left and i sat dow n at the table to pick up where id left off but no matter where i looked my fountai n pen was nowhere in sight i took another look margot looked mother looked fa ther looked dussel looked but it had vanished maybe it fell in the stove along with the beans margot sug gested no it couldnt have i replied but that evening when my fountain pen still hadnt turned up we all assumed it had been burned especially because celluloid is highly inflam mable our darkest fears were confirmed the next day when father went to empty the stove and discovered the clip used to fasten it to a pocket among the ashes not a trace of th e gold nib was left it must have melted into stone father conjectured im left with one consolation small though it may be my foun tain pen was cremated just as i would like to be someday yours anne wednesday november 17 1943 dearest kitty recent events have the house rocking on its foundations owi ng to an outbreak of diphtheria at beps she wont be allowed to come in contact w ith us for six weeks without her the cooking and shopping will be very difficult not to mention how much well miss her company mr kleiman is still in bed and has eat en nothing but gruel for three weeks mr kugler is up to his neck in work margot sends her latin lessons to a teacher who corrects and then returns them shes registered under beps name the teachers very nice and witty too i bet hes glad to have such a smart student dussel is in a turmoil and we dont know why it all began with d ussels saying nothing when he was upstairs he didnt exchange so much as a w ord with either mr or mrs van daan we all noticed it this went on for a few days and then mother took the opportunity to warn him about mrs van d who could m ake life miserable for him dussel said mr van daan had started the silent treat ment and he had no intention of breaking it i should explain that yesterday wa s november 16 the first anniversary of his living in the annex mother received a pla nt in honor of the occasion but mrs van daan who had alluded to the date for we eks and made no bones about the fact that she thought dussel should treat us t o dinner received nothing instead of making use of the opportunity to thank us for the first time for unselfishly taking him in he didnt utter a word and o n the morning of the sixteenth when i asked him whether i should offer him my cong ratulations or my condolences he replied that either one would do mother ha ving cast herself in the role of peacemaker made no headway whatsoever and the situ ation finally ended in a draw i can say without exaggeration that dussel has definitely go t a screw loose we often laugh to ourselves because he has no memory no fixed opinion s and no common sense hes amused us more than once by trying to pass on the ne ws hes just heard since the message invariably gets garbled in transmission furthermore he answers every reproach or accusation with a load of fine 1 promises which he never manages to keep der mann hat einen grossen geist una ist so klein van taten a wellknown expression the spirit of the man is great how puny are his deeds yours anne saturday november 27 1943 dearest kitty last night just as i was falling asleep hanneli suddenly ap peared before me i saw her there dressed in rags her face thin and worn she lo oked at me with such sadness and reproach in her enormous eyes that i could read th e message in them oh anne why have you deserted me help me help me rescue m e from this hell and i cant help her i can only stand by and watch while other p eople suffer and die all i can do is pray to god to bring her back to us i saw hanneli and no one else and i understood why i misjudged her wasnt mature enough t o understand how difficult it was for her she was devoted to her girlfriend a nd it must have seemed as though i were trying to take her away the poor thing she must have felt awful i know because i recognize the feeling in myself i had an occa sional flash of understanding but then got selfishly wrapped up again in my own problems and pleasures it was mean of me to treat her that way and now she was looking a t me oh so helplessly with her pale face and beseeching eyes if only i could help her dear god i have everything i could wish for while fate has her in its de adly clutches she was as devout as i am maybe even more so and she too wanted to do wh at was right but then why have i been chosen to live while shes probably g oing to die whats the difference between us why are we now so far apart to be honest i hadnt thought of her for months no for at le ast a year i hadnt forgotten her entirely and yet it wasnt until i saw her befo re me that i thought of all her suffering oh hanneli i hope that if you live to the end of the war and ret urn to us ill be able to take you in and make up for the wrong ive done you but even if i were ever in a position to help she wouldnt need it more than she does now i wonder if she ever thinks of me and what shes feeling merciful god comfort her so that at least she wont be alone oh if only you could tell her im thinking of her with compassion and love it migh t help her go on ive got to stop dwelling on this it wont get me anywhere i k eep seeing her enormous eyes and they haunt me does hanneli really and tru ly believe in god or has religion merely been foisted upon her i dont even know t hat i never took the trouble to ask hanneli hanneli if only i could take you away if only i coul d share everything i have with you its too late i cant help or undo the wrong ive do ne but ill never forget her again and ill always pray for her yours anne monday december 6 1943 dearest kitty the closer it got to st nicholas day the more we all thought b ack to last years festively decorated basket more than anyone i thought it would be terrible to skip a cele bration this year after long deliberation i finally came up with an idea something funny i consulted rim and a week ago we set to work writing a verse for each person sunday evening at a quarter to eight we trooped upstairs carr ying the big laundry basket which had been decorated with cutouts and bows made o f pink and blue carbon paper on top was a large piece of brown wrapping paper with a n ote attached everyone was rather amazed at the sheer size of the gift i rem oved the note and read it aloud once again st nicholas day has even come to our hideaway it wont be quite as jun i fear as the happy day we had last year then we were hopeful no reason to doubt that optimism would win the bout and by the time this year came round wed all be free and s and sound still lets not jorget its st nicholas day though weve nothing left to give away well have to find something else to do so everyone please look in their shoe as each person took their own shoe out of the basket there was a roar of laughter inside each shoe was a little wrapped package addressed to it s owner yours anne dearest kitty a bad case of flu has prevented me from writing to you until tod ay being sick here is dreadful with every cough i had to duck under the blanket once twice three times and try to keep from coughing anymore most of the time the tickle refused to go away so i had to drink milk with honey sugar or cough drops i get dizzy just thinking about all the c ures ive been subjected to sweating out the fever steam treatment wet compresses dry compresses hot drinks swabbing my throat lying still heating pad hotw ater bottles lemonade and every two hours the thermometer will these remedies reall y make you better the worst part was when mr dussel decided to play doctor and lay h is pomaded head on my bare chest to listen to the sounds not only did his hair tic kle but i was embarrassed even though he went to school thirty years ago a nd does have some kind of medical degree why should he lay his head on my heart afte r all hes not my boyfriend for that matter he wouldnt be able to tell a heal thy sound from an unhealthy one hed have to have his ears cleaned first since hes becoming alarmingly hard of hearing but enough about my illness im fit as a fiddle agai n ive grown almost half an inch and gained two pounds im pale but itching to get bac k to my books ausnahmsweise the only word that will do here by way of ex ception were all getting on well together no squabbles though that probabl y wont last long there hasnt been such peace and quiet in this house for at least six months bep is still in isolation but any day now her sister will no lo nger be contagious for christmas were getting extra cooking oil candy and mo lasses for hanukkah mr dussel gave mrs van daan and mother a beautiful cake which h ed asked miep to bake on top of all the work she has to do margot and i received a brooch made out of a penny all bright and shiny i cant really describe it b ut its lovely i also have a christmas present for miep and bep for a whole mo nth ive saved up the sugar i put on my hot cereal and mr kleiman has used it to h ave fondant made the weather is drizzly and overcast the stove stinks and th e food lies heavily on our stomachs producing a variety of rumbles the war is at an impasse spirits are low yours anne friday december 24 1943 dear kitty as ive written you many times before moods have a tendency t o affect us quite a bit here and in my case its been getting worse lately himm elhoch jauchzend zu tode betrubt a famous line from goethe on top of the wo rld or in the depths of despair certainly applies to me im on top of the worl d when i think of how fortunate we are and compare myself to other jewish children and in the depths of despair when for example mrs kleiman comes by and talks a bout jopies hockey club canoe trips school plays and afternoon teas with frie nds i dont think im jealous of jopie but i long to have a really g ood time for once and to laugh so hard it hurts were stuck in this house like lepers especially during win ter and the christmas and new years holidays actually i shouldnt even be writing t his since it makes me seem so ungrateful but i cant keep everything to myself so ill repeat what i said at the beginning paper is more patient than people whenever someone comes in from outside with the wind in thei r clothes and the cold on their cheeks i feel like burying my head under the blanket s to keep from thinking when will we be allowed to breathe fresh air again i cant d o that on the contrary i have to hold my head up high and put a bold face on th ings but the thoughts keep coming anyway not just once but over and over believe me if youve been shut up for a year and a half it can g et to be too much for you sometimes but feelings cant be ignored no matter h ow unjust or ungrateful they seem i long to ride a bike dance whistle look at the wo rld feel young and know that im free and yet i cant let it show just imagine wh at would happen if all eight of us were to feel sorry for ourselves or walk around wit h the discontent clearly visible on our faces where would that get us i sometimes won der if anyone will ever understand what i mean if anyone will ever overlook my i ngratitude and not worry about whether or not im jewish and merely see me as a tee nager badly in need of some good plain fun i dont know and i wouldnt be abl e to talk about it with anyone since im sure id start to cry crying can bring reli ef as long as you dont cry alone despite all my theories and efforts i miss ever y day and every hour of the day having a mother who understands me thats why with everything i do and write i imagine the kind of mom id like to be to my childre n later on the kind of mom who doesnt take everything people say too seriously but who does take me seriously i find it difficult to describe what i mean but th e word mom says it all do you know what ive come up with in order to give me the feeli ng of calling my mother something that sounds like mom i often call her mo msy sometimes i shorten it to moms an imperfect mom i wish i could honor her by removing the s its a good thing she doesnt realize this since it woul d only make her unhappy well thats enough of that my writing has raised me somewha t from the depths of despair yours anne its the day after christmas and i cant help thinking about pim and the story he told me this time last year i didnt understand the meaning of his words then as well as i do now if only hed bring it up again i might be able to show hi m i understood what he meant i think pim told me because he who knows the intimate secret s of so many others needed to express his own feelings for once pim never talks a bout himself and i dont think margot has any inkling of what hes been through poor pim he cant fool me into thinking hes forgotten that girl he never will it s made him very accommodating since hes not blind to mothers faults i ho pe im going to be a little like him without having to go through what he has anne monday december 27 1943 friday evening for the first time in my life i received a chr istmas present mr kleiman mr kugler and the girls had prepared a wonderful su rprise for us miep made a delicious christmas cake with peace 1944 written on top and bep provided a batch of cookies that was up to prewar standards there was a jar of yogurt for peter margot and me and a bottle of beer for each of the adults and once again everything was wrapped so nicely with pretty pictures glued to the packages for the rest the holidays passed by qu ickly for us anne wednesday december 29 1943 i was very sad again last night grandma and hanneli came to me once more grandma oh my sweet grandma how little we understood what she suffered how kind she always was and what an interest she took in everythin g that concerned us and to think that all that time she was carefully guarding her terrible secret annes grandmother was terminally ill grandma was always so loyal and good she would never have let any of us down whatever happened no matter how much i misbehaved grandma always stuck up for me grandma did you love me or did you not understand me eith er i dont know how lonely grandma must have been in spite of us you can be lo nely even when youre loved by many people since youre still not bddi a ny 0 y s one an only and hanneli is she still alive whats she doing dear god w atch over her and bring her back to us hanneli youre a reminder of what my fate migh t have been i keep seeing myself in your place so why am i often miserable about what goes on here shouldnt i be happy contented and glad except when im thi nking of hanneli and those suffering along with her im selfish and cowardly wh y do i always think and dream the most awful things and want to scream in terror beca use in spite of everything i still dont have enough faith in god hes give n me so much which i dont deserve and yet each day i make so many mistakes thinking about the suffering of those you hold dear can reduc e you to tears in fact you could spend the whole day crying the most you can do is pra y for god to perform a miracle and save at least some of them and i hope im doing enough of that anne thursday december 30 1943 dearest kitty since the last raging quarrels things have settled down her e not only between ourselves dussel and upstairs but also between mr and m rs van d nevertheless a few dark thunderclouds are heading this way and all becaus e of food mrs van d came up with the ridiculous idea of frying fewer potatoes i n the morning and saving them for later in the day mother and dussel and the rest of us d idnt agree with her so now were dividing up the potatoes as well it seems the fat s and oils arent being doled out fairly and mothers going to have to put a stop to it ill let you know if there are any interesting developments for the last few mon ths now weve been splitting up the meat theirs with fat ours without the so up they eat it we dont the potatoes theirs peeled ours not the extras and now th e fried potatoes too if only we could split up completely yours anne ps bep had a picture postcard of the entire royal family cop ied for me juliana looks very young and so does the queen the three little girl s are adorable it was incredibly nice of bep dont you think sunday january 2 1944 dearest kitty this morning when i had nothing to do i leafed through the pa ges of my diary and came across so many letters dealing with the subject of moth er in such strong terms that i was shocked i said to myself anne is that really you talking about hate oh anne how could you i continued to sit with the open book in my hand and wonder why i was filled with so much anger and hate that i had to confide it all to you i tried t o understand the anne of last year and make apologies for her because as long as i le ave you with these accusations and dont attempt to explain what prompted them my conscience wont be clear i was suffering then and still do from moods that kep t my head under water figuratively speaking and allowed me to see things only fr om my own perspective without calmly considering what the others those whom i w ith my mercurial temperament had hurt or offended had said and then actin g as they would have done i hid inside myself thought of no one but myself and calmly wr ote down all my joy sarcasm and sorrow in my diary because this diary has become a kind of memory book it means a great deal to me but i could easily write ove r and done with on many of its pages i was furious at mother and still am a lot of the time its tr ue she didnt understand me but i didnt understand her either because s he loved me she was tender and affectionate but because of the difficult situa tions i put her in and the sad circumstances in which she found herself she was nervous an d irritable so i can understand why she was often short with me i was offended took it far too much to heart and was insolent a nd beastly to her which in turn made her unhappy we were caught in a vicious c ircle of unpleasantness and sorrow not a very happy period for eithe r of us but at least its coming to an end i didnt want to see what was going on and i fe lt very sorry for myself but thats understandable too those violent outbursts on paper are simply expressions of a nger that in normal life i could have worked off by locking myself in my room and stampi ng my foot a few times or calling mother names behind her back the period of tearfully passing judgment on mother is over i ve grown wiser and mothers nerves are a bit steadier most of the time i manage t o hold my tongue when im annoyed and she does too so on the surface we seem t o be getting along better but theres one thing i cant do and thats to love mo ther with the devotion of a child i soothe my conscience with the thought that its better for u nkind words to be down on paper than for mother to have to carry them around in her hea rt yours anne thursday january 6 1944 dearest kitty today i have two things to confess its going to take a long ti me but i have to tell them to someone and youre the most likely candidate since i know youll keep a secret no matter what happens the first is about mother as you know ive frequently compl ained about her and then tried my best to be nice ive suddenly realized whats wrong with her mother has said that she sees us more as friends than as daughters that s all very nice of course except that a friend cant take the place of a mother i need my mother to set a good example and be a person i can respect but in most matter s shes an example of what not to do i have the feeling that margot thinks so diff erently about these things that shed never be able to understand what ive just t old you and father avoids all conversations having to do with mother i imagine a mother as a woman who first and foremost possess es a great deal of tact especially toward her adolescent children and not on e who like momsy pokes fun at me when i cry not because im in pain but because of oth er things this may seem trivial but theres one incident ive never fo rgiven her for it happened one day when i had to go to the dentist mother and margot plann ed to go with me and agreed i should take my bicycle when the dentist was fini shed and we were back outside margot and mother very sweetly informed me that the y were going downtown to buy or look at something i dont remember what and of cour se i wanted to go along but they said i couldnt come because i had my bike with me tears of rage rushed to my eyes and margot and mother began laughing at me i was so furious that i stuck my tongue out at them right there on the street a little old lady happened to be passing by and she looked terribly shocked i rode my bike home and must have cried for hours strangely enough even though mot her has wounded me thousands of times this particular wound still stings when ever i think of how angry i was i find it difficult to confess the second one because its abo ut myself im not prudish kitty and yet every time they give a blowbyblow account of their trips to the bathroom which they often do my whole body rises in revolt yesterday i read an article on blushing by sis heyster it was as if shed addressed it directly to me not that i blush easily but the rest of the art icle did apply what she basically says is that during puberty girls withdraw into th emselves and begin thinking about the wondrous changes taking place in their bodies i fe el that too which probably accounts for my recent embarrassment over margot mother and father on the other hand margot is a lot shyer than i am and yet shes no t in the least embarrassed i think that whats happening to me is so wonderful and i don t just mean the changes taking place on the outside of my body but also those on the in side i never discuss myself or any of these things with others which is why i have t o talk about them to myself whenever i get my period and thats only been three t imes i have the feeling that in spite of all the pain discomfort and mess i m carrying around a sweet secret so even though its a nuisance in a certain way im al ways looking forward to the time when ill feel that secret inside me once again sis heyster also writes that girls my age feel very insecure a bout themselves and are just beginning to discover that theyre individuals with th eir own ideas thoughts and habits id just turned thirteen when i came here so i starte d thinking about myself and realized that ive become an independent person soone r than most girls sometimes when i lie in bed at night i feel a terrible urge to to uch my breasts and listen to the quiet steady beating of my heart unconsciously i had these feelings even before i came here once when i was spending the night at jacques i could no longer restrain my curiosity about her body which shed always hidden from me and which id never seen i a sked her whether as proof of our friendiship we could touch each others breast s jacque refused i also had a terrible desire to kiss her which i did every tim e i see a female nude such as the venus in my art history book i go into ecstasy som etimes i find them so exquisite i have to struggle to hold back my tears if only i had a girlfriend thursday january 6 1944 dearest kitty my longing for someone to talk to has become so unbearable tha t i somehow took it into my head to select peter for this role on the few occasion s when i have gone to peters room during the day ive always thought it was nice a nd cozy but peters too polite to show someone the door when theyre bothering him s o ive never dared to stay long ive always been afraid hed think i was a pest iv e been looking for an excuse to linger in his room and get him talking without his no ticing and yesterday i got my chance peter you see is currently going through a cr osswordpuzzle craze and he doesnt do anything else all day i was helping him and we soon wound up sitting across from each other at his table peter on the chai r and me on the divan it gave me a wonderful feeling when i looked into his dark blue eyes and saw how bashful my unexpected visit had made him i could read his inn ermost thoughts and in his face i saw a look of helplessness and uncertainty as to how to behave and at the same time a flicker of awareness of his masculinity i saw his shyness and i melted i wanted to say tell me about yourself look beneath my chat ty exterior but i found that it was easier to think up questions than to ask them the evening came to a close and nothing happened except tha t i told him about the article on blushing not what i wrote you of course just tha t he would grow more secure as he got older that night i lay in bed and cried my eyes out all the i while mak ing sure no one could hear me the idea that i had to beg peter for favors was si mply revolting but people will do almost anything to satisfy their longings ta ke me for example ive made up my mind to visit peter more often and somehow get him to talk to me you mustnt think im in love with peter because im not if t he van daans had had a daughter instead of a son id have tried to make friends with her this morning i woke up just before seven and immediately reme mbered what id been dreaming about i was sitting on a chair and across from me was peter peter schiff we were looking at a book of drawings by mary bos the d ream was so vivid i can even remember some of the drawings but that wasnt all the dream went on peters eyes suddenly met mine and i stared for a long tim e into those velvety brown eyes then he said very softly if id only known id h ave come to you long ago i turned abruptly away overcome by emotion and then i felt a soft ohsocool and gentle cheek against mine and it felt so good so good at that point i woke up still feeling his cheek against mine a nd his brown eyes staring deep into my heart so deep that he could read how much id loved him and how much i still do again my eyes filled with tears and i was s ad because id lost him once more and yet at the same time glad because i knew with certainty that peter is still the only one for me its funny but i often have such vivid images in my dreams on e night i saw grammy grammy is annes grandmother on her fathers side and grandma her grandmother on her mothers side so clearly that i could ev en make out her skin of soft crinkly velvet another time grandma appeared to me as a guardian angel after that it was hanneli who still symbolizes to me the suffering of my friends as well as that of jews in general so that when im praying for her im a lso praying for all the jews and all those in need and now peter my dearest peter ive never had such a clear me ntal image of him i dont need a photograph i can see him oh so well yours anne friday anuary 7 1944 dearest kitty im such an idiot i forgot that i havent yet told you the stor y of my one true love when i was a little girl way back in kindergarten i took a lik ing to sally kimmel his father was gone and he and his mother lived with an aunt o ne of sallys cousins was a goodlooking slender darkhaired boy named appy wh o later turned out to look like a movie idol and aroused more admiration than the sh ort comical chubby sally for a long time we went everywhere together but aside from that my love was unrequited until peter crossed my path i had an outandout crush on him he liked me too and we were inseparable for one whole summer i can sti ll see us walking hand in hand through our neighborhood peter in a white cotto n suit and me in a short summer dress at the end of the summer vacation he went to the s eventh grade at the middle school while i was in the sixth grade at the gramma r school hed pick me up on the way home or id pick him up peter was the ideal boy t all goodlooking and slender with a serious quiet and intelligent face he h ad dark hair beautiful brown eyes ruddy cheeks and a nicely pointed nose i was craz y about his smile which made him look so boyish and mischievous id gone away to the countryside during summer vacation and when i came back peter was no longer at his old address hed moved and was livi ng with a much older boy who apparently told him i was just a kid because peter st opped seeing me i loved him so much that i didnt want to face the truth i kept cl inging to him until the day i finally realized that if i continued to chase after him people would say i was boycrazy the years went by peter hung around with girls his own age and no longer bothered to say hello to me i started school at the jewish lyceum and s everal boys in my class were in love with me i enjoyed it and felt honored by the ir attentions but that was all later on hello had a terrible crush on me but as ive already told you i never fell in love again theres a saying time heals all wounds thats how it was w ith me i told myself id forgotten peter and no longer liked him in the least but m y memories of him were so strong that i had to admit to myself that the only reason i no longer liked him was that i was jealous of the other girls this morning i realized that nothing has changed on the contrary as ive grown older and more mature my love h as grown along with me i can understand now that peter thought i was childish an d yet it still hurts to think hed forgotten me completely i saw his face so clearly i knew for certain that no one but peter could have stuck in my mind that way ive been in an utter state of confusion today when father ki ssed me this morning i wanted to shout oh if only you were peter ive been think ing of him constantly and all day long ive been repeating to myself oh petel my darling darling petel where can i find help i simply have to go on living and praying to god that if we ever get out of here peters path will cross mine and hell ga ze into my eyes read the love in them and say oh anne if id only known id have come to you long ago once when father and i were talking about sex he said i was too young to understand that kind of desire but i thought i did understan d it and now im sure i do nothing is as dear to me now as my darling petel i saw my face in the mirror and it looked so different my eyes were clear and deep my cheeks were rosy which they hadnt been in weeks my mouth was much softer i looked happy and yet there was something so sad in my express ion that the smile immediately faded from my lips im not happy since i know pe tels not thinking of me and yet i can still feel his beautiful eyes gazing at me and his cool soft cheek against mine oh petel petel how am i ever going to free m yself from your image wouldnt anyone who took your place be a poor substitu te i love you with a love so great that it simply couldnt keep growing inside my h eart but had to leap out and reveal itself in all its magnitude a week ago even a day ago if youd asked me which of your fri ends do you think youd be most likely to marry id have answered sally si nce he makes me feel good peaceful and safe but now id cry petel because i l ove him with all my heart and all my soul i surrender myself completely excep t for that one thing he may touch my face but thats as far as it goes this morning i imagined i was in the front attic with petel si tting on the floor by the windows and after talking for a while we both began to cry m oments later i felt his mouth and his wonderful cheek oh petel come to me think of me my dearest petel wednesday january 12 1944 dearest kitty beps been back for the last two weeks though her sister won t be allowed back at school until next week bep herself spent two days in bed with a bad cold miep and jan were also out for two days with upset stomachs im currently going through a dance and ballet craze and am di ligently practicing my dance steps every evening ive made an ultramodern dance co stume out of a lacy lavender slip belonging to momsy bias tape is threaded thro ugh the top and tied just above the bust a pink corded ribbon completes the ensemble i tried to turn my tennis shoes into ballet slippers but with no success my st iff limbs are well on the way to becoming as limber as they used to be a terrific exerci se is to sit on the floor place a heel in each hand and raise both legs in the air i have to sit on a cushion because otherwise my poor backside really takes a b eating everyone here is reading a book called a cloudless morning m other thought it was extremely good because it describes a number of adolescent p roblems i thought to myself a bit ironically why dont you take more interest i n your own adolescents first i think mother believes that margot and i have a better relati onship with our parents than anyone in the whole wide world and that no mother is more involved in the lives of her children than she is she must have my sister in mind si nce i dont believe margot has the same problems and thoughts as i do far be it fro m me to point out to mother that one of her daughters is not at all what she imagi nes shed be completely bewildered and anyway shed never be able to ch ange id like to spare her that grief especially since i know that everything woul d remain the same mother does sense that margot loves her much more than i do but she th inks im just going through a phase margots gotten much nicer she seems a lot different than sh e used to be shes not nearly as catty these days and is becoming a real friend she n o longer thinks of me as a litde kid who doesnt count its funny but i can sometimes see myself as others see me i t ake a leisurely look at the person called anne frank and browse through the page s of her life as though she were a stranger before i came here when i didnt think about things as much as i do now i occasionally had the feeling that i didnt belong to momsy p im and margot and that i would always be an outsider i sometimes went around for six m onths at a time pretending i was an orphan then id chastise myself for play ing the victim when really id always been so fortunate after that id force my self to be friendly for a while every morning when i heard footsteps on the stairs i h oped it would be mother coming to say good morning id greet her warmly beca use i honesly did look forward to her affectionate glance but then shed snap at me for having made some comment or other and id go off to school feeling completely discouraged on the way home id make excuses for her telling myself that s he had so many worries id arrive home in high spirits chatting nineteen to the dozen until the events of the morning would repeat themselves and id leave the room with my schoolbag in my hand and a pensive look on my face sometimes id decide to s tay angry but then i always had so much to talk about after school that id forget my resolution and want mother to stop whatever she was doing and lend a willing ear t hen the time would come once more when i no longer listened for the steps on the st airs and felt lonely and cried into my pillow every night everything has gotten much worse here but you already knew t hat now god has sent someone to help me peter i fondle my pendant press it to my l ips and think what do i care petel is mine and nobody knows it with this in mind i can rise above every nasty remark which of the people here would suspect th at so much is going on in the mind of a teenage girl saturday january 15 1944 my dearest kitty theres no reason for me to go on describing all our quarrels a nd arguments down to the last detail its enough to tell you that weve divided ma ny things like meat and fats and oils and are frying our own potatoes recently weve been eating a little extra rye bread because by four oclock were so hungry for di nner we can barely control our rumbling stomachs mothers birthday is rapidly approaching she received som e extra sugar from mr kugler which sparked off jealousy on the part of the van daan s because mrs van d didnt receive any on her birthday but whats the point of bo ring you with harsh words spiteful conversations and tears when you know they b ore us even more mother has expressed a wish which isnt likely to come true a ny time soon not to have to see mr van daans face for two whole weeks i wonder if everyone who shares a house sooner or later ends up at odds with their fello w residents or have we just had a stroke of bad luck at mealtime when dussel help s himself to a quarter of the halffilled gravy boat and leaves the rest of u s to do without i lose my appetite and feel like jumping to my feet knocking him off his chair and throwing him out the door are most people so stingy and selfish ive gained some insig ht into human nature since i came here which is good but ive had enough for the pr esent peter says the same the war is going to go on despite our quarrels and our longing f or freedom and fresh air so we should try to make the best of our stay here im preaching but i also believe that if i live here much long er ill turn into a driedup old beanstalk and all i really want is to be an hones ttogoodness teenager yours anne wednesday evening january 19 1944 dearest kitty i there i go again dont know whats happened but since my dream i keep noticing how ive changed by the way i dreamed about peter again last night and once again i felt his eyes penetrate mine but this dream was less vivid an d not quite as beautiful as the last you know that i always used to be jealous of margots relation ship with father theres not a trace of my jealousy left now i still feel hurt w hen fathers nerves cause him to be unreasonable toward me but then i think i ca nt blame you for being the way you are you talk so much about the minds of child ren and adolescents but you dont know the first thing about them i long for more than fathers affection more than his hugs and kisses isnt it awful of me to be so preoccupied with myself shouldnt i who want to be good and kind forgiv e them first i forgive mother too but every time she makes a sarcastic remark or lau ghs at me its all i can do to control myself i know im far from being what i should will i ever be anne frank ps father asked if i told you about the cake for mothers bi rthday she received a real mocha cake prewar quality from the office it was a rea lly nice day but at the moment theres no room in my head for things like that saturday january 22 1944 dearest kitty can you tell me why people go to such lengths to hide their real selves or why i always behave very differently when im in the company of oth ers why do people have so little trust in one another i know there must be a reas on but sometimes i think its horrible that you cant ever confide in anyone no t even those closest to you it seems as if ive grown up since the night i had that dream as if ive become more independent youll be amazed when i tell you that even my att itude toward the van daans has changed ive stopped looking at all the discussio ns and arguments from my familys biased point of view whats brought on such a radic al change well you see i suddenly realized that if mother had been different if she d been a real mom our relationship would have been very very different mrs van daan is by no means a wonderful person yet half the arguments could have been avo ided if mother hadnt been so hard to deal with every time they got onto a tricky subj ect mrs van daan does have one good point though you can talk to her she may b e selfish stingy and underhanded but shell readily back down as long as you don t provoke her and make her unreasonable this tactic doesnt work every time but i f youre patient you can keep trying and see how far you get all the conflicts about our upbringing about not pampering children about the food about everything absolutely everything might have ta ken a different turn if wed remained open and on friendly terms instead of always se eing the worst side i know exactly what youre going to say kitty but anne are these words really coming from your lips fro m you who have had to put up with so many unkind words from upstairs from you who a re aware of all the injustices and yet they are coming from me i want to take a fresh look at th ings and form my own opinion not just ape my parents as in the proverb the ap ple never falls far from the tree i want to reexamine the van daans and decide fo r myself whats true and whats been blown out of proportion if i wind up being dis appointed in them i can always side with father and mother but if not i can try to change their attitude and if that doesnt work ill have to stick with my own opinio ns and judgment ill take every opportunity to speak openly to mrs van d about ou r many differences and not be afraid despite my reputation as a smart aleck to of fer my impartial opinion i wont say anything negative about my own family t hough that doesnt mean i wont defend them if somebody else does and as of today my g ossiping is a thing of the past up to now i was absolutely convinced that the van daans were en tirely to blame for the quarrels but now im sure the fault was largely ours we w ere right as far as the subject matter was concerned but intelligent people such as ourselves should have more insight into how to deal with others i hope ive got at least a touch of that insight and that ill f ind an occasion to put it to good use yours anne monday january 24 1944 dearest kitty a very strange thing has happened to me actually happene d isnt quite the right word before i came here whenever anyone at home or at school talke d about sex they were either secretive or disgusting any words having to do w ith sex were spoken in a low whisper and kids who werent in the know were often laug hed at that struck me as odd and i often wondered why people were so mysterious o r obnoxious when they talked about this subject but because i couldnt chang e things i said as little as possible or asked my girlfriends for information after id learned quite a lot mother once said to me anne l et me give you some good advice never discuss this with boys and if they bring i t up dont answer them i still remember my exact reply no of course not i exclai med imagine and nothing more was said when we first went into hiding father often told me about thi ngs id rather have heard from mother and i learned the rest from books or things i picked up in conversations peter van daan wasnt ever as obnoxious about this subject as the boys at school or maybe just once or twice in the beginning though he wasnt t rying to get me to talk mrs van daan once told us shed never discussed these matter s with peter and as far as she knew neither had her husband apparently she didnt e ven know how much peter knew or where he got his information yesterday when margot peter and i were peeling potatoes t he conversation somehow turned to boche were still not sure whether boche is a boy o r a girl are we i asked yes we are he answered boche is a tomcat i began to laugh some tomcat if hes pregnant peter and margot joined in the laughter you see a month or tw o ago peter informed us that boche was sure to have kittens before long because he r stomach was rapidly swelling however boches fat tummy turned out to be due to a bunch of stolen bones no kittens were growing inside much less about to be b orn peter felt called upon to defend himself against my accusati on come with me you can see for yourself i was horsing around with the cat one day and i could definitely see it was a he unable to restrain my curiosity i went with him to the wareho use boche however wasnt receiving visitors at that hour and was nowhere in si ght we waited for a while but when it got cold we went back upstairs later that afternoon i heard peter go downstairs for the seco nd time i mustered the courage to walk through the silent house by myself and reache d the warehouse boche was on the packing table playing with peter who was getting ready to put him on the scale and weigh him hi do you want to have a look without any preliminaries h e picked up the cat turned him over on his back deftly held his head and paws and b egan the lesson this is the male sexual organ these are a few stray hairs an d thats his backside the cat flipped himself over and stood up on his little white f eet if any other boy had pointed out the male sexual organ to me i would never have given him a second glance but peter went on talking in a norma l voice about what is otherwise a very awkward subject nor did he have any ulterio r motives by the time hed finished i felt so much at ease that i started acting nor mally too we played with boche had a good time chatted a bit and finally saunter ed through the long warehouse to the door were you there when mouschi was fixed yeah sure it doesnt take long they give the cat an anesth etic of course do they take something out no the vet just snips the tube theres nothing to see on the outside i had to get up my nerve to ask a question since it wasnt as no rmal as i thought peter the german word geschlechtsteil means sexual orga n doesnt it but then the male and female ones have different names i know that the female one is a vagina that i know but i dont know what i ts called in males oh well i said how are we supposed to know these words mo st of the time you just come across them by accident why wait ill ask my parents they know more than i do and the yve had more experience we were already on the stairs so nothing more was said yes it really did happen id never have talked to a girl abou t this in such a normal tone of voice im also certain that this isnt what mother me ant when she warned me about boys all the same i wasnt exactly my usual self for the rest of the day when i thought back to our talk it struck me as odd but ive learned at least one thing there are young people even those of the opposite sex who can discuss these things naturally without cracking jokes is peter really going to ask his parents a lot of questions is he really the way he seemed yesterday oh what do i know yours anne friday january 28 1944 dearest kitty in recent weeks ive developed a great liking for family tree s and the genealogical tables of royal families ive come to the conclusion that on ce you begin your search you have to keep digging deeper and deeper into the past whic h leads you to even more interesting discoveries although im extremely diligent when it comes to my schoolwo rk and can pretty much follow the bbc home service on the radio i still spend many of my sundays sorting out and looking over my moviestar collection which has gro wn to a very respectable size mr kugler makes me happy every monday by bringing me a c opy of cinema theater magazine the less worldly members of our household often refer to this small indulgence as a waste of money yet they never fail to be surprised at how accurately i can list the actors in any given movie even afte r a year bep who often goes to the movies with her boyfriend on her day off tells me o n saturday the name of the show theyre going to see and i then p roceed to rattle off the names of the leading actors and actresses and the reviews moms recently remarked that i wouldnt need to go to the movies later on be cause i know all the plots the names of the stars and the reviews by h eart whenever i come sailing in with a new hairstyle i i can read th e disapproval on their faces and i can be sure someone will ask which movie star im t rying to imitate my reply that its my own invention is greeted with skeptici sm as for the hairdo it doesnt hold its set for more than half an hour by that time i m so sick and tired i of their remarks that i race to the bathroom and restore my hai r to its normal mass of curls yours anne friday january 28 1944 dearest kitty this morning i was wondering whether you ever felt like a cow having to chew my stale news over and over again until youre so fed up with the m onotonous fare that you yawn and secretly wish anne would dig up something new sorry i know you find it dull as ditchwater but imagine how s ick and tired i am of hearing the same old stuff if the talk at mealtime isnt abou t politics or good food then mother or mrs van d trot out stories about their childh ood that weve heard a thousand times before or dussel goes on and on about beautif ul racehorses his charlottes extensive wardrobe leaky rowboats boys who c an swim at the age of four aching muscles and frightened patients it all boils down to this whenever one of the eight of us opens his mouth the other seven can finish the sto ry for him we know the punch line of every joke before it gets told so that whoev ers telling it is left to laugh alone the various milkmen grocers and butchers of th e two former housewives have been praised to the skies or run into the ground so many ti mes that in our imaginations theyve grown as old as methuselah theres ab solutely no chance of anything new or fresh being brought up for discussion in the a nnex still all this might be bearable if only the grownups weren t in the habit of repeating the stories we hear from mr kleiman jan or miep each time em bellishing them with a few details of their own so that i often have to pinch my arm u nder the table to keep myself from setting the enthusiastic storyteller on th e right track little children such as anne must never ever correct their elders no matte r how many blunders they make or how often they let their imaginations run away wi th them jan and mr kleiman love talking about people who have gone un derground or into hiding they know were eager to hear about others in our situ ation and that we truly sympathize with the sorrow of those whove been arrested as w ell as the joy of prisoners whove been freed going underground or into hiding has become as routine as the proverbial pipe and slippers that used to await the man of the house after a long da y at work there are many resistance groups such as free netherlands that forg e identity cards provide financial support to those in hiding organize hiding place s and find work for young christians who go underground its amazing how much these g enerous and unselfish people do risking their own lives to help and save others the best example of this is our own helpers who have managed t o pull us through so far and will hopefully bring us safely to shore because othe rwise theyll find themselves sharing the fate of those theyre trying to prote ct never have they uttered a single word about the burden we must be never have they comp lained that were too much trouble they come upstairs every day and talk to the men about business and politics to the women about food and wartime difficulti es and to the children about books and newspapers they put on their most cheerful e xpressions bring flowers and gifts for birthdays and holidays and are always r eady to do what they can thats something we should never forget while others displ ay their heroism in battle or against the germans our helpers prove theirs every day by their good spirits and affection the most bizarre stories are making the rounds yet most of th em are really true for instance mr kleiman reported this week that a soccer match was held in the province of gelderland one team consisted entirely of men who had gon e underground and the other of eleven military policemen in hilversum new regis tration cards were issued in order for the many people in hiding to get their rations yo u have to show this card to obtain your ration book or else pay 60 guilders a book the registrar asked all those hiding in that district to pick up their cards at a speci fied hour when the documents could be collected at a separate table all the same you have to be careful that stunts like these don t reach the ears of the germans yours anne sunday january 30 1944 my dearest kit another sunday has rolled around i dont mind them as much as i did in the beginning but theyre boring enough i still havent gone to the warehouse yet but maybe sometime soon last night i went downstairs in the dark all by myself after having been ther e with father a few nights before i stood at the top of the stairs while german planes fl ew back and forth and i knew i was on my own that i couldnt count on others for suppor t my fear vanished i looked up at the sky and trusted in god i have an intense need to be alone father has noticed im not m y usual self but i cant tell him whats bothering me all i want to do is scream let me be leave me alone who knows perhaps the day will come when im left alone more t han id like anne frank thursday february 3 1944 dearest kitty invasion fever is mounting daily throughout the country if you were here im sure youd be as impressed as i am at the many preparations though youd no doubt laugh at all the fuss were making who knows it may all be for nothi ng the papers are full of invasion news and are driving everyone insane with such statements as in the event of a british landing in holland the germans will do what they can to defend the country even flooding it if necessar y theyve published maps of holland with the potential flood areas marked since large portions of amsterdam were shaded in our first question was what we shou ld do if the water in the streets rose to above our waists this tricky question el icited a variety of responses itll be impossible to walk or ride a bike so well have to wa de through the water dont be silly well have to try and swim well all put on ou r bathing suits and caps and swim underwater as much as we can so nobody can see were j ews oh baloney i can just imagine the ladies swimming with the rats biting their legs that was a man of course well see who screams loudest we wont even be able to leave the house the warehouse is so u nstable itll collapse if theres a flood listen everyone all joking aside we really ought to try a nd get a boat why bother i have a better idea we can each take a packing cr ate from the attic and row with a wooden spoon im going to walk on stilts i used to be a whiz at it when i was y oung jan gies wont need to hell let his wife ride piggyback an d then miep will be on stilts so now you have a rough idea of whats going on dont you kit this lighthearted banter is all very amusing but reality will prove otherwise the second question about the invasion was bound to arise what should we do if the germa ns evacuate amsterdam leave the city along with the others disguise ourselves as well as we can whatever happens dont go outside the best thing to do is t o stay put the germans are capable of herding the entire population of holl and into germany where theyll all die of course well stay here this is the safest place well try to talk kleiman and his family into coming here to li ve with us well somehow get hold of a bag of wood shavings so we can sleep on th e floor lets ask miep and kleiman to bring some blankets just in case and we ll order some extra cereal grains to supplement the sixtyfive pounds we alread y have jan can try to find some more beans at the moment weve got about sixtyfive pou nds of beans and ten pounds of split peas and dont forget the fifty cans of veget ables what about the rest mother give us the latest figures ten cans of fish forty cans of milk twenty pounds of powder ed milk three bottles of oil four crocks of butter four jars of meat two big jars o f strawberries two jars of raspberries twenty jars of tomatoes ten pounds of oatme al nine pounds of rice thats it our provisions are holding out fairly well all the same we h ave to feed the office staff which means dipping into our stock every week so its not as much as it seems we have enough coal and firewood candles too lets all make little moneybags to hide in our clothes so we c an take our money with us if we need to leave here we can make lists of what to take first in case we have to run fo r it and pack our knapsacks in advance when the time comes well put two people on the lookout one in the loft at the front of the house and one in the back hey whats the use of so much food if there isnt any water g as or electricity well have to cook on the wood stove filter the water and boi l it we should clean some big jugs and fill them with water we can also store water in the three kettles we use for canning and in the washtub besides we still have about two hundred and thirty pounds o f winter potatoes in the spice storeroom all day long thats all i hear invasion invasion nothing b ut invasion arguments about going hungry dying bombs fire extinguishers sleeping b ags identity cards poison gas etc etc not exactly cheerful a good example of the explicit warnings of the male contingen t is the following conversation with jan annex were afraid that when the germans retreat theyll take the entire population with them jan thats impossible they havent got enough trains annex trains do you really think theyd put civilians on t rains absolutely not everyone would have to hoof it or as dussel always says p er pedes apostolorum jan i cant believe that youre always looking on the dark side what reason would they have to round up all the civilians and take them along annex dont you remember goebbels saying that if the germa ns have to go theyll slam the doors to all the occupied territories behind them jan theyve said a lot of things annex do you think the germans are too noble or humane to do i t their reasoning is if we go under well drag everyone else down with us jan you can say what you like i just dont believe annex its always the same old story no one wants to see the danger until its staring them in the face jan but you dont know anything for sure youre just makin g an assumption annex because weve already been through it all ourselves first in germany and then here what do you thinks happening in russia jan you shouldnt include the jews i dont think anyone kn ows whats going on in russia the british and the russians are probably exaggerat ing for propaganda purposes just like the germans annex absolutely not the bbc has always told the truth an d even if the news is slightly exaggerated the facts are bad enough as they are y ou cant deny that millions of peaceloving citizens in poland and russia have been murdered or gassed ill spare you the rest of our conversations im very calm an d take no notice of all the fuss ive reached the point where i hardly care whether i live or die the world will keep on turning without me and i cant do anything to cha nge events anyway ill just let matters take their course and concentrate on studyi ng and hope that everything will be all right in the end yours anne tuesday february 8 1944 dear kitty i cant tell you how i feel one minute im longing for peace an d quiet and the next for a little fun weve forgotten how to laugh i mean laugh ing so hard you can t stop this morning i had the giggles you know the kind we used to have at school margot and i were giggling like real teenagers last night there was another scene with mother margot was tu cking her wool blanket around her when suddenly she leapt out of bed and carefully ex amined the blanket what do you think she found a pin mother had patched the blan ket and forgotten to take it out father shook his head meaningfully and made a com ment about how careless mother is soon afterward mother came in from the ba throom and just to tease her i said du bist doch eine echte rabenmutter oh you are cruel of course she asked me why id said that and we told her about the pin shed overlooked she immediately assumed her haughtiest expres sion and said youre a fine one to talk when youre sewing the entire floor is cove red with pins and look youve left the manicure set lying around again you never pu t that away either i said i hadnt used it and margot backed me up since she was t he guilty party mother went on talking about how messy i was until i got fed up a nd said rather curtly i wasnt even the one who said you were careless im always getting blamed for other peoples mistakes mother fell silent and less than a minute later i was obliged to kiss her goodnight this incident may not have been very important but these day s everything gets on my nerves anne mary frank saturday february 12 1944 dearest kitty the sun is shining the sky is deep blue theres a magnificen t breeze and im longing really longing for everything conversation freedom friends being alone i long to cry i feel as if i were about to explode i know cryi ng would help but i cant cry im restless i walk from one room to another brea the through the crack in the window frame feel my heart beating as if to say fulfill my longing at last i think spring is inside me i feel spring awakening i feel it in my entire body and soul i have to force myself to act normally im in a state of u tter confusion dont know what to read what to write what to do i only know that i m longing for something yours anne 186 anne frank monday february 14 1944 dearest kitty a lot has changed for me since saturday whats happened is th is i was longing for something and still am but a small a very small part o f the problem has been resolved on sunday morning i noticed to my great joy ill be honest wi th you that peter kept looking at me not in the usual way i dont know i cant e xplain it but i suddenly had the feeling he wasnt as in love with margot as i u sed to think all day long i tried not to look at him too much because whenever i did i caught him looking at me and then well it made me feel wonderful inside and th ats not a feeling i should have too often sunday evening everyone except pim and me was clustered ar ound the radio listening to the immortal music of the german masters dus sel kept twisting and turning the knobs which annoyed peter and the others too a fter restraining himself for half an hour peter asked somewhat irritably if he would s top fiddling with the radio dussel replied in his haughtiest tone ich mach das schon ill decide that peter got angry and made an insolent remark mr van daan side d with him and dussel had to back down that was it the reason for the disagreement wasnt particularly intere sting in and of itself but peter has apparently taken the matter very much to heart bec ause this morning when i was rummaging around in the crate of books in the attic pete r came up and began telling me what had happened i didnt know anything about it but peter soon realized hed found an attentive listener and started warming up to hi s subject well its like this he said i dont usually talk much s ince i know beforehand ill just be tonguetied i start stuttering and blushing and i tw ist my words around so much i finally have to stop because i cant find the right wor ds thats what happened yesterday i meant to say something entirely different but once i started i got all mixed up its awful i used to have a bad habit and sometimes i wish i still did whenever i was mad at someone id beat them up instead of argu ing with them i know this method wont get me anywhere and thats why i admir e you youre never at a loss for words you say exactly what you want to say and are nt in the least bit shy oh youre wrong about that i replied most of what i say c omes out very differently from the way id planned plus i talk too much and too long and thats just as bad maybe but you have the advantage that no one can see youre e mbarrassed you dont blush or go to pieces i couldnt help being secretly amused at his words however since i wanted him to go on talking quietly about himself i hid my laughter sat down on a cushion on the floor wrapped my arms around my knees and gazed at him intently im glad theres someone else in this house who flies into the same rages as i do peter seemed relieved that he could criticize dussel withou t being afraid id tell as for me i was pleased too because i sensed a strong feeling of fellowship which i only remember having had with my girlfriends yours anne tuesday february 15 1944 the minor runin with dussel had several repercussions for which he had only himself to blame monday evening dussel came in to see mother and told her triumphantly that peter had asked him that morning if hed sl ept well and then added how sorry he was about what had happened sunday evening he h adnt really meant what hed said dussel assured him he hadnt taken it to heart so everything was right as rain again mother passed this story on to me and i was secretly amazed that peter whod been so angry at dussel had humbled himsel f despite all his assurances to the contrary i couldnt refrain from sounding peter out on the subject an d he instantly replied that dussel had been lying you should have seen peters face i wi sh id had a camera indignation rage indecision agitation and much more cro ssed his face in rapid succession that evening mr van daan and peter really told dussel off bu t it couldnt have been all that bad since peter had another dental appointment tod ay actually they never wanted to speak to each other again wednesday february 16 1944 peter and i hadnt talked to each other all day except for a fe w meaningless words it was too cold to go up to the attic and anyway it was margots b irthday at twelvethirty he came to look at the presents and hung around chatting longer than was strictly necessary something hed never have done othe rwise but i got my chance in the afternoon since i felt like spoiling margot on her birthday i went to get the coffee and after that the potatoes when i came to pet ers room he immediately took his papers off the stairs and i asked if i sh ould close the trapdoor to the attic sure he said go ahead when youre ready to come back dow n just knock and ill open it for you i thanked him went upstairs and spent at least ten minutes se arching around in the barrel for the smallest potatoes my back started aching an d the attic was cold naturally i didnt bother to knock but opened the trapdoor myself but he obligingly got up and took the pan out of my hands i did my best but i couldnt find any smaller ones did you look in the big barrel yes ive been through them all by this time i was at the bottom of the stairs and he examined t he pan of potatoes he was still holding oh but these are fine he said and ad ded as i took the pan from him my compliments as he said this he gave me such a warm tender look that i start ed glowing inside i could tell he wanted to please me but since he couldnt make a long complimentary speech he said everything with his eyes i understood him so well and was very grateful it still makes me happy to think back to those words and that look when i went downstairs mother said she needed more potatoes this time for dinner so i volunteered to go back up when i entered peters room i a pologized for disturbing him again as i was going up the stairs he stood up went over to stand between the stairs and the wall grabbed my arm and tried to st op me ill go he said i have to go upstairs anyway i replied that it wasnt really necessary that i didnt have to get only the small ones this time convinced he let go of my arm on my way back he ope ned the trapdoor and once again took the pan from me standing by the door i ask ed what are you working on french he replied i asked if i could take a look at his lessons then i went to wash my hands and sat down across from him on the divan after id explained some french to him we began to talk he to ld me that after the war he wanted to go to the dutch east indies and live on a rubber plantation he talked about his life at home the black market and how he felt like a worthless bum i told him he had a big inferiority complex he talked about th e war saying that russia and england were bound to go to war against each other and about the jews he said life would have been much easier if hed been a christi an or could become one after the war i asked if he wanted to be baptized but that wasnt what he meant either he said hed never be able to feel like a christian bu t that after the war hed make sure nobody would know he was jewish i felt a momentary p ang its such a shame he still has a touch of dishonesty in him peter added the jews have been and always will be the chosen people i answered just this once i hope theyll be chosen for some thing good but we went on chatting very pleasantly about father about judging human character and all sorts of things so many that i cant even remember the m all i left at a quarter past five because bep had arrived that evening he said something else i thought was nice we wer e talking about the picture of a movie star id once given him which has been hang ing in his room for at least a year and a half he liked it so much that i offered to giv e him a few more no he replied id rather keep the one ive got i look at i t every day and the people in it have become my friends i now have a better understanding of why he always hugs mousch i so tightly he obviously needs affection too i forgot to mention somethin g else he was talking about he said no im not afraid except when it comes to things ab out myself but im working on that peter has a huge inferiority complex for example he always thinks hes so stupid and were so smart when i help him with french he thanks me a thou sand times one of these days im going to say oh cut it out youre much bette r at english and geography anne frank thursday february 17 1944 dear kitty i was upstairs this morning since i promised mrs van d id r ead her some of my stories i began with evas dream which she liked a lot an d then i read a few passages from the secret annex which had her in stitches peter also listened for a while just the last part and asked if id come to his room som etime to read more i decided i had to take a chance right then and there so i got my notebook and let him read that bit where cady and hans talk about god i cant re ally tell what kind of impression it made on him he said something i dont quite rem ember not about whether it was good but about the idea behind it i told him i j ust wanted him to see that i didnt write only amusing things he nodded and i left the room well see if i hear anything more yours anne frank friday february 18 1944 my dearest kitty whenever i go upstairs its always so i can see him now tha t i have something to look forward to my life here has improved greatly at least the object of my friendship is always here and i don t have to be afraid of rivals except for margot dont think im in love because im not but i do have the feeling that something beautiful is going to develop betwee n peter and me a kind of friendship and a feeling of trust i go see him whenever i get t he chance and its not the way it used to be when he didnt know what to make of me on t he contrary hes still talking away as im heading out the door mother do esnt like me going upstairs she always says im bothering peter and that i shou ld leave him alone honestly cant she credit me with some intuition she alway s looks at me so oddly when i go to peters room when i come down again she asks me wh ere ive been its terrible but im beginning to hate her yours anne m frank saturday february 19 1944 dearest kitty its saturday again and that should tell you enough this mo rning all was quiet i spent nearly an hour upstairs making meatballs but i only sp oke to him in passing when everyone went upstairs at twothirty to either read or t ake a nap i went downstairs with blanket and all to sit at the desk and read o r write before long i couldnt take it anymore i put my head in my arms and sobbed my heart out the tears streamed down my cheeks and i felt desperately unhapp y oh if only he had come to comfort me it was past four by the time i went upstairs again at five ocl ock i set off to get some potatoes hoping once again that wed meet but while i w as still in the bathroom fixing my hair he went to see boche i wanted to help mrs van d and went upstairs with my book and e verything but suddenly i felt the tears coming again i raced downstairs to the bathroom grabbing the hand mirror on the way i sat there on the toilet fully dre ssed long after i was through my tears leaving dark spots on the red of my apron an d i felt utterly dejected heres what was going through my mind oh ill never reach p eter this way who knows maybe he doesnt even like me and he doesnt need anyon e to confide in maybe he only thinks of me in a casual sort of way ill have to g o back to being alone without anyone to confide in and without peter witho ut hope comfort or anything to look forward to oh if only i could rest my head on his shoulder and not feel so hopelessly alone and deserted who knows maybe he do esnt care for me at all and looks at the others in the same tender way maybe i only imagined it was especially for me oh peter if only you could hear me or see m e if the truth is disappointing i wont be able to bear it a little later i felt hopeful and full of expectation again t hough my tears were still flowing on the inside yours anne m frank sunday february 20 1944 what happens in other peoples houses during the rest of the w eek happens here in the annex on sundays while other people put on their best clo thes and go strolling in the sun we scrub sweep and do the laundry eight oclock though the rest of us prefer to sleep in dussel gets up at eight he goes to the bathroom then downsta irs then up again and then to the bathroom where he devotes a whole hour to washing himself ninethirty the stoves are lit the blackout screen is take n down and mr van daan heads for the bathroom one of my sunday morning ordeals is ha ving to lie in bed and look at dussels back when hes praying i know it sounds stra nge but a praying dussel is a terrible sight to behold its not that he cries or gets sentimental not at all but he does spend a quarter of an hour an entire fifteen minutes rocking from his toes to his heels back and forth back and forth it g oes on forever and if i dont shut my eyes tight my head starts to spin tenfifteen the van daans whistle the bathrooms free in the frank family quarters the first sleepy faces are beginning to emerge from their pil lows then everything happens fast fast fast margot and i take turns doing the la undry since its quite cold downstairs we put on pants and head scarves meanwhile father is busy in the bathroom either margot or i have a turn in the bathroom at ele ven and then were all clean eleventhirty breakfast i wont dwell on this since ther es enough talk about food without my bringing the subject up as well twelvefifteen we each go our separate ways father clad i n overalls gets down on his hands and knees and brushes the rug so vigorously that the room is enveloped in a cloud of dust mr dussel makes the beds all wrong of course always whistling the same beethoven violin concerto as he goes about his work mot her can be heard shuffling around the attic as she hangs up the washing mr va n daan puts on his hat and disappears into the lower regions usually followed by p eter and mouschi mrs van d dons a long apron a black wool jacket and overshoes wi nds a red wool scarf around her head scoops up a bundle of dirty laundry and with a wellrehearsed washerwomans nod heads downstairs margot and i do the dis hes and straighten up the room wednesday february 231944 my dearest kitty the weathers been wonderful since yesterday and ive perk ed up quite a bit my writing the best thing i have is coming along well i go to th e attic almost every morning to get the stale air out of my lungs this morning when i went there peter was busy cleaning up he finished quickly and came over to whe re i was sitting on my favorite spot on the floor the two of us looked out at the bl ue sky the bare chestnut tree glistening with dew the seagulls and other bi rds glinting with silver as they swooped through the air and we were so moved and entranc ed that we couldnt speak he stood with his head against a thick beam while i sat we breathed in the air looked outside and both felt that the spell shouldnt be broken with words we remained like this for a long while and by the time he had to go to the loft to chop wood i knew he was a good decent boy he climbed the ladder to the loft and i followed during the fifteen minutes he was chopping wood w e didnt say a word either i watched him from where i was standing and could see he was obviously doing his best to chop the right way and show off his strength but i also looked out the open window letting my eyes roam over a large part of amst erdam over the rooftops and on to the horizon a strip of blue so pale it was al most invisible as long as this exists i thought this sunshine and this c loudless sky and as long as i can enjoy it how can i be sad the best remedy for those who are frightened lonely or unhap py is to go outside somewhere they can be alone alone with the sky nature and go d for then and only then can you feel that everything is as it should be and that go d wants people to be happy amid natures beauty and simplicity as long as this exists and that should be forever i know that there will be solace for every sorrow whatever the circumstances i firmly believe that nature can bring comfort to all who suffer oh who knows perhaps it wont be long before i can share this overwhelming feeling of happiness with someone who feels the same as i do yours anne ps thoughts to peter weve been missing out on so much here so very much and for su ch a long time i miss it just as much as you do im not talking about external t hings since were well provided for in that sense i mean the internal things like y ou i long for freedom and fresh air but i think weve been amply compensated for th eir loss on the inside i mean this morning when i was sitting in front of the window and tak ing a long deep look outside at god and nature i was happy just plain happy pete r as long as people feel that kind of happiness within themselves the joy of nature health and much more besides theyll always be able to recapture that happiness riches prestige everything can be lost but the happiness in your own heart can only be dimmed it will always be there as long as you live to make you happy again whenever youre feeling lonely or sad try going to the loft o n a beautiful day and looking outside not at the houses and the rooftops but at th e sky as long as you can look fearlessly at the sky youll know that youre pure w ithin and will find happiness once more sunday february 27 1944 my dearest kitty from early in the morning to late at night all i do is think abo ut peter i fall asleep with his image before my eyes dream about him and wake up with him still looking at me i have the strong feeling that peter and i arent really as dif ferent as we may seem on the surface and ill explain why neither peter nor i have a mother his is too superficial likes to flirt and doesnt concern herself muc h with what goes on in his head mine takes an active interest in my life but has no tact sensitivity or motherly understanding both peter and i are struggling with our innermost feelings were still unsure of ourselves and are too vulnerable emotionally to be dealt w ith so roughly whenever that happens i want to run outside or hide my feelings inste ad i bang the pots and pans splash the water and am generally noisy so that everyo ne wishes i were miles away peters reaction is to shut himself up say little sit quietly and daydream all the while carefully hiding his true self but how and when will we finally reach each other i dont know how much longer i can continue to keep this yearni ng under control yours anne m frank monday february 28 1944 my dearest kitty its like a nightmare one that goes on long after im awake i see him nearly every hour of the day and yet i cant be with him i cant let the other s notice and i have to pretend to be cheerful though my heart is aching peter schiff and peter van daan have melted into one peter wh os good and kind and whom i long for desperately mothers horrible fathers ni ce which makes him even more exasperating and margots the worst since she takes a dvantage of my smiling face to claim me for herself when all i want is to be left alone peter didnt join me in the attic but went up to the loft to do s ome carpentry work at every rasp and bang another chunk of my courage broke off a nd i was even more unhappy in the distance a clock was tolling be pure in hear t be pure in mind im sentimental i know im despondent and foolish i know t hat too oh help me yours anne m frank wednesday march 1 1944 dearest kitty my own affairs have been pushed to the background by a brea kin im boring you with all my breakins but what can i do when burglars take such pleasure in honoring gies go with their presence this incident is muc h more complicated than the last one in july 1943 last night at seventhirty mr van daan was heading as usual for mr kuglers office when he saw that both the glass door and the office door were op en he was surprised but he went on through and was even more astonishe d to see that the alcove doors were open as well and that there was a terrible me ss in the front office theres been a burglary flashed through his mind but just to make sure he went downstairs to the front door checked the lock and found ever ything closed bep and peter must just have been very careless this evening mr va n d concluded he remained for a while in mr kuglers office switched off the lamp and went upstairs without worrying much about the open doors or the messy offic e early this morning peter knocked at our door to tell us that th e front door was wide open and that the projector and mr kuglers new briefcase ha d disappeared from the closet peter was instructed to lock the door mr van daan to ld us his discoveries of the night before and we were extremely worried the only explanation is that the burglar must have had a dupli cate key since there were no signs of a forced entry he must have sneaked in early i n the evening shut the door behind him hidden himself when he heard mr van daan fled with the loot after mr van daan went upstairs and in his hurry not bother ed to shut the door who could have our key why didnt the burglar go to the wareho use was it one of our own warehouse employees and will he turn us in now that h es heard mr van daan and maybe even seen him its really scary since we dont know whether the burglar wi ll take it into his head to try and get in again or was he so startled when he heard someon e else in the building that hell stay away yours anne ps wed be delighted if you could hunt up a good detective fo r us obviously theres one condotion he must be relied upon not to mform on people in hiding thursday march 2 1944 dearest kitty margot and i were in the attic together today i cant enjoy be ing there with her the way i imagine itd be with peter or someone else i know she f eels the same about most things as i do while doing the dishes bep began talking to mother and mrs v an daan about how discouraged she gets what help did those two offer her our t actless mother especially only made things go from bad to worse do you know what her advice was that she should think about all the other people in the wo rld who are suffering how can thinking about the misery of others help if youre mis erable yourself i said as much their response of course was that i should stay out of conversations of this sort the grownups are such idiots as if peter margot bep and i d idnt all have the same feelings the only thing that helps is a mothers love o r that of a very very close friend but these two mothers dont understand the fir st thing about us perhaps mrs van daan does a bit more than mother oh i wish i could ha ve said something to poor bep something that i know from my own experience woul d have helped but father came between us pushing me roughly aside theyre al l so stupid i also talked to margot about father and mother about how nic e it could be here if they werent so aggravating wed be able to organize evenin gs in which everyone could take turns discussing a given subject but weve alrea dy been through all that its impossible for me to talk here mr van daan goes on the of fensive mother i gets sarcastic and cant say anythina in a normal voice father do esnt feel like taking part nor does mr dussel and mrs van d is attacked so often that s he just sits there with a red face hardly able to put up a fight anymore and what about us we arent allowed to have an opinion my my arent they progressive not have an opinion people can tell you to shut up but they cant keep you from hav ing an opinion you cant forbid someone to have an opinion no matter how young t hey are the only thing that would help bep margot peter and me would be great love and devotion which we dont get here and no one especially not the idioti c sages around here is capable of understanding us since were more sensitive and much more advanced in our thinking than any of them ever suspect love what is love i dont think you can really put it into wor ds love is understanding someone caring for him sharing his joys and sorrows this eventually includes physical love youve shared something given som ething away and received something in return whether or not youre married whether or not you have a baby losing your virtue doesnt matter as long as you know that fo r as long as you live youll have someone at your side who understands you and who doesnt have to be shared with anyone else yours anne m frank at the moment mothers grouching at me again shes clearly jealous because i talk to mrs van daan more than to her what do i care i managed to get hold of peter this afternoon and we talked fo r at least fortyfive minutes he wanted to tell me something about himself but di dnt find it easy he finally got it out though it took a long time i honestly didn t know whether it was better for me to stay or to go but i wanted so much to help him i told him about bep and how tactless our mothers are he told me that his paren ts fight constantly about politics and cigarettes and all kinds of things as iv e told you before peters very shy but not too shy to admit that hed be perfectly happy not to see his parents for a year or two my father isnt as nice as he looks he said but in the matter of the cigarettes mothers absolutely right i also told him about my mother but he came to fathers defens e he thought he was a terrific guy tonight when i was hanging up my apron after doing the dishes he called me over and asked me not to say anything downstairs about his parents having had another argument and not being on speaking terms i promised though id already told margot but im sure margot wont pass it on oh no peter i said you dont have to worry about me ive l earned not to blab everything i hear i never repeat what you tell me he was glad to hear that i also told him what terrible gossips we are and said margots quite right of course when she says im not being honest because as much as i want to stop gossiping theres nothing i like better tha n discussing mr dussel its good that you admit it he said he blushed and his sin cere compliment almost embarrassed me too then we talked about upstairs and downstairs some more peter was really rather surprised to hear that dont like his parents peter i sai d you know im always honest so why shouldnt i tell you this as well we can see the ir faults too i added peter id really like to help you will you let me y oure caught in an awkward position and i know even though you dont say anyth ing that it upsets you oh your help is always welcome maybe itd be better for you to talk to father you can tell hi m anything he wont pass it on i know hes a real pal you like him a lot dont you peter nodded and i continued well he likes you too you kn ow he looked up quickly and blushed it was really touching to se e how happy these few words made him you think so he asked yes i said you can tell from the little things he lets sli p now and then then mr van daan came in to do some dictating peters a terrific guy just like father yours anne m frank friday march 31944 my dearest kitty when i looked into the candle tonight i felt calm and happy ag ain it seems grandma is in that candle and its grandma who watches over and prote cts me and makes me feel happy again but theres someone else who governs al l my moods and thats peter i went to get the potatoes today and while i was stand ing on the stairway with my pan full he asked what did you do during the lunch br eak i sat down on the stairs and we began to talk the potatoes did nt make it to the kitchen until fivefifteen an hour after id gone to get the m peter didnt say anything more about his parents we just talked about books a nd about the past oh he gazes at me with such warmth in his eyes i dont think it wil l take much for me to fall in love with him he brought the subject up this evening i went to his room afte r peeling potatoes and remarked on how hot it was you can tell the temperature by lo oking at margot and me because we turn white when its cold and red when its hot i said in love he asked why should i be in love it was a pretty silly answer or rat her question why not he said and then it was time for dinner what did he mean today i finally managed to ask him whether my chatter bothered him all he said was oh its fine with me i cant tell how much of his reply was d ue to shyness kitty i sound like someone whos in love and can talk about no thing but her dearest darling and peter is a darling will i ever be able to tell him that only if he thinks the same of me but im the kind of person you have to treat with kid gloves i know that all too well and he likes to be left alone so i dont know how much he likes m e in any case were getting to know each other a little better i wish we dar ed to say more but who knows maybe that time will come sooner than i think once or twice a day he gives me a knowing glance i wink back an d were both happy it seems crazy to talk about his being happy and yet i h ave the overwhelming feeling he thinks the same way i do yours anne m frank saturday march 4 1944 dear kitty this is the first saturday in months that hasnt been tiresom e dreary and boring the reason is peter this morning as i was on my way to the attic to h ang up my apron father asked whether i wanted to stay and practice my french and i said yes we spoke french together for a while and i explained something t o peter and then we worked on our english father read aloud from dickens and i w as in seventh heaven since i was sitting on fathers chair close to peter i went downstairs at quarter to eleven when i went back up at e leventhirty peter was already waiting for me on the stairs we talked until quar ter to one whenever i leave the room for example after a meal and peter has a chanc e and no one else can hear he says bye anne see you later oh im so happy i wonder if hes going to fall in love with me a fter all in any case hes a nice boy and you have no idea how good it is to talk to him mrs van d thinks its all right for me to talk to peter but today she asked me teasingly can i trust you two u p there of course i protested i take that as an insult morning noon and night i look forward to seeing peter yours anne m frank ps before i forget last night everything was blanketed in s now now its thawed and theres almost nothing left monday march 6 1944 dearest kitty ever since peter told me about his parents ive felt a certai n sense of responsibthty toward himdont you think thats strange its as though th eir quarrels were just as much my business as his and yet i dont dare bring it up anymor e because im afraid it makes him uncomfortable i wouldnt want to intrude not f or all the money in the world i can tell by peters face that he ponders things just as deepl y as i do last night i was annoyed when mrs van d scoffed the thinker peter fl ushed and looked embarrassed and i nearly blew my top why dont these people keep their mouths shut you cant imagine what its like to have to stand on the sideli nes and see how lonely he is without being able to do anything i can imagine as if i were in his place how despondent he must sometimes feel at the quarrels and about love poor peter he needs to be loved so much it sounded so cold when he said he didnt need any friends oh hes so wrong i dont think he means it he clings to his masculinity his solitude and his feigned indif ference so he can maintain his role so hell never ever have to show his feelings poor peter how long can he keep it up wont he explode from th is superhuman effort oh peter if only i could help you if only you would let me to gether we could banish our loneliness yours and mine ive been doing a great deal of thinking but not saying much im happy when i see him and happier still if the sun shines when were together i washed my hair yesterday and because i knew he was next door i was very ramb unctious i couldnt help it the more quiet and serious i am on the inside the nois ier i get on the outside who will be the first to discover the chink in my armor its just as well that the van daans dont have a daughter my c onquest could never be so challenging so beautiful and so nice with someone of the s ame sex yours anne m frank ps you know im always honest with you so i think i should tel l you that i live from one encounter to the next i keep hoping to discover that hes dying to see me and im in raptures when i notice his bashful attempts i think he d like to be able to express himself as easily as i do little does he know its his awkwardness that i find so touching tuesday march 71944 dearest kitty when i think back to my life in 1942 it all seems so unreal the anne frank who enjoyed that heavenly existence was completely different f rom the one who has grown wise within these walls yes it was heavenly five admirers on every street corner twenty or so friends the favorite of most of my teachers spo iled rotten by father and mother bags full of candy and a big allowance what more c ould anyone ask for youre probably wondering how i could have charmed all those people peter says it s ecause i m attractive but that isnt it entirely the teac hers were amused and entertained by my clever answers my witty remarks my smthn g face and my critical mind thats all i was a terrible flirt coquettish and amus ing i had a few plus points which kept me in everybodys good graces i was hardworking honest and generous i would never have refused anyone who wanted to peek at my answe rs i was magnanimous with my candy and i wasnt stuckup would all that admiration eventually have made me overconfi dent its a good thing that at the height of my glory i was suddenly plunged into re ality it took me more than a year to get used to doing without admiration how did they see me at school as the class comedian the etern al ringleader never in a bad mood never a crybaby was it any wonder that everyone wanted to bicycle to school with me or do me little favors i look back at that anne frank as a pleasant amusing but supe rficial girl who has nothing to do with me what did peter say about me whenever i saw you you were surrounded by a flock of girls and at least two boys you were a lways laughing and you were always the center of attention he was right whats remained of that anne frank oh i havent forgotten h ow to laugh or toss off a remark im just as good if not better at raking people ove r the coals and i can still flirt and be amusing if i want to be but theres the catch id like to live that seemingly carefr ee and happy life for an evening a few days a week at the end of that week id be exhau sted and would be grateful to the first person to talk to me about something mea ningful i want friends not admirers peo ple who respect me for my character and my d eeds not my flattering smile the circle around me would be much smaller but what does that matter as long as theyre sincere in spite of everything i wasnt altogether happy in 1942 i o ften felt id been deserted but because i was on the go all day long i didnt thi nk about it i enjoyed myself as much as i could trying consciously or unconscious ly to fill the void with jokes looking back i realize that this period of my life has irrevo cably come to a close my happygolucky carefree schooldays are gone forever i do nt even miss them ive outgrown them i can no longer just kid around since my serio us side is always there i see my life up to new years 1944 as if i were looking through a powerful magnifying glass when i was at home my life was filled with s unshine then in the middle of 1942 everything changed overnight the quarrels the accusations i couldnt take it all in i was caught off guard and the only wa y i knew to keep my bearings was to talk back the first half of 1943 brought crying spells loneliness and the gradual realization of my faults and short comings which were numerous and seemed even more so i filled the day with chatter tried to draw pim closer to me and failed this left me on my own to face the difficult task of improving myself so i woul dnt have to hear their reproaches because they made me so despondent the second half of the year was slightly better i became a tee nager and was treated more like a grownup i began to think about things and to writ e stories finally coming to the conclusion that the others no longer had anythi ng to do with me they had no right to swing me back and forth like a pendulum on a cloc k i wanted to change myself in my own way i realized i could man age withou t my mother completely and totally and that hurt but what affected me e ven more was the realization that i was never going to be able to confide in fat her i didnt trust anyone but myself after new years the second big change occurred my dream th rough which i discovered my longing for a boy not for a girlfriend but for a boyfriend i also discovered an inner happiness underneath my superficial an d cheerful exterior from time to time i was quiet now i live only for peter since what h appens to me in the future depends largely on him i lie in bed at night after ending my prayers with the words i ch janke air fur all das cute una liebe una schone thank you god for all that is good and dear and beautiful and im filled with joy i think of going into hid ing my health and my whole being as das cute peters love which is still so new an d fragile and which neither of us dares to say aloud the future happiness and l ove as das liebe the world nature and the tremendous beauty of everything all t hat splendor as das schone at such moments i dont think about all the misery but about t he beauty that still remains this is where mother and i differ greatly her advic e in the face of melancholy is think about all the suffering in the world an d be thankful youre not part of it my advice is go outside to the country enjoy t he sun and all nature has to offer go outside and try to recapture the happiness withi n yourself think of all the beauty in yourself and in everything around you and be happy i dont think mothers advice can be right because what are y ou supposed to do if you become part of the suffering youd be completely lost o n the contrary beauty remains even in misfortune if you just look for it you disc over more and more happiness and regain your balance a person whos happy will make others happy a person who has courage and faith will never die in misery yours anne m frank wednesday march 8 1944 margot and i have been writing each other notes just for fun of course anne its strange but i can only remember the day after what has happened the night before for example i suddenly remembered that mr dussel w as snoring loudly last night its now quarter to three on wednesday af ternoon an d mr dussel is snoring again which is why it flashed through my mind of course wh en i had to use the potty i deliberately made more noise to get the snoring to st op margot which is better the snoring or the gasping for air anne the snorings better because it stops when i make nois e without waking the person in question what i didnt write to margot but what ill confess to you de ar kitty is that ive been dreaming of peter a great deal the night before last i dr eamed i was skating right here in our living room with that little boy from the apo llo iceskating rink he was with his sister the girl with the spindly legs who always wore the same blue dress i introduced myself overdoing it a bit and asked him his name it was peter in my dream i wondered just how many peters i actually knew then i dreamed we were standing in peters room facing each o ther beside the stairs i said something to him he gave me a kiss but replied that he d idnt love me all that much and that i shouldnt flirt in a desperate and pleading v oice i said im not flirting peter when i woke up i was glad peter hasnt said it after all last night i dreamed we were kissing each other but peters cheeks were very disappointing they werent as sof t as they looked they were more like fathers cheeks the cheeks of a man who alrea dy shaves friday march 10 1944 my dearest kitty the proverb misfortunes never come singly defi nitely ap plies to today peter just got through saying it let me tell you all the awful things tha t have happened and that are still hanging over our heads first miep is sick as a result of henk and aagjes wedding ye sterday she caught cold in the westerkerk where the service was held second m r kleiman hasnt returned to work since the last time his stomach started blee ding so beps been left to hold down the fort alone third the police have arrested a man whose name i wont put in writing its terrible not only for him but for us as well since hes been supplying us with potatoes butter and jam mr m as ill ca ll him has five children under the age of thirteen and another on the way last night we had another little scare we were in the middle o f dinner when suddenly someone knocked on the wall next door for the rest of the even ing we were nervous and gloomy lately i havent been at all in the mood to write down whats be en going on here ive been more wrapped up in myself dont get me wrong im terrib ly upset about whats happened to poor goodhearted mr m but theres not much r oom for him in my diary tuesday wednesday and thursday i was in peters room from fo urthirty to fivefifteen we worked on our french and chatted about one t hing and another i really look forward to that hour or so in the afternoon but be st of all is that i think peters just as pleased to see me yours anne m frank the diary of a young girl 213 saturday march 11 1944 dearest kitty i havent been able to sit still lately i wander up stairs an d down and then back again i like talking to peter but im always afraid of being a nuisance hes told me a bit about the past about his parents and about himself but i ts not enough and every five minutes i wonder why i find myself longing for more he us ed to think i was a real pain in the neck and the feeling was mutual ive change d my mind but how do i know hes changed his i think he has but that doesnt necess arily mean we have to become the best of friends although as far as im concerned it would make our time here more bearable but i wont let this drive me crazy i spen d enough time thinking about him and dont have to get you all worked up as well simpl y because im so miserable sunday march 12 1944 dearest kitty things are getting crazier here as the days go by peter hasnt looked at me since yesterday hes been acting a s if hes mad at me im doing my best not to chase after him and to talk to him as little as possible but its not easy whats going on what makes him keep me at arms leng th one minute and rush back to my side the next perhaps im imagining that its worse than it really is perhaps hes just moody like me and tomorrow everything wil l be all right again i have the hardest time trying to maintain a normal facade whe n im feeling so wretched and sad i have to talk help around the house sit wi th the others and above all act cheerful most of all i miss the outdoors and ha ving a place where i can be alone for as long as i want i think im getting everything a ll mixed up kitty but then im in a state of utter confusion on the one hand im ha lf crazy with desire for him can hardly be in the same room without looking at him and on the other hand i wonder why he should matter to me so much and why i cant be calm again day and night during every waking hour i do nothing but ask m yself have you given him enough chance to be alone have you been spending to o much time upstairs do you talk too much about serious subjects hes no t yet ready to talk about maybe he doesnt even like you has it all been your ima gination but then why has he told you so much about himself is he sorry he did a nd a whole lot more yesterday afternoon i was so worn out by the sad news from the o utside that i lay down on my divan for a nap all i wanted was to sleep and not have to think i slept until four but then i had to go next door it wasnt easy answ ering all mothers questions and inventing an excuse to explain my nap to father i pleaded a headache which wasnt a lie since i did have one on the inside ordinary people ordinary girls teenagers like myself wo uld think im a little nuts with all my selfpity but thats just it i pour my heart out t o you and the rest of the time im as impudent cheerful and selfconfident as pos sible to avoid questions and keep from getting on my own nerves margot is very kind and would like me to confide in her but i ca nt tell her everything she takes me too seriously far too seriously a nd spends a lot of time thinking about her loony sister looking at me closely whene ver i open my mouth and wondering is she acting or does she really mean it its because were always together i dont want the person i confide in to be around me all the time when will i untangle my jumbled thoughts whe n will i find inner peace again yours anne tuesday march 14 1944 dearest kitty it might be amusing for you though not for me to hear what we re going to eat today the cleaning lady is working downstairs so at the mom ent im seated at the van daans oilclothcovered table with a handkerchief spri nkled with fragrant prewar perfume pressed to my nose and mouth you probably dont have the faintest idea what im talking about so let me begin at the begin ning t he people who supply us with food coupons have been arrested so we have just our fi ve blackmarket ra tion booksno coupons no fats and oils since miep and mr kleiman are sick again bep cant manage the shop ping the food is wretched and so are we as of tomor row we wont have a scrap of fat butter or margarine we cant eat fried potatoes for breakfast which weve been doing to save on bre ad so were having hot cereal instead and because mrs van d thinks were starvin g we bought some halfandhalf lunch today consists of mashed potatoes and pickled kale this explains the precautionary measure with the handkerchief you wouldnt believe how much kale can stink when its a few years old the kitchen smel ls like a mixture of spoiled plums rotten eggs and brine ugh just the thought o f having to eat that muck makes me want to throw up besides that our potatoes have con tracted such strange diseases that one out of every two buckets of pommes de terre w inds up in the garbage we entertain ourselves by trying to figure out whic h disease theyve got and weve reached the conclusion that they suffer from cancer s mallpox and measles honestly being in hiding during the fourth year of the war is no picnic if only the whole stinking mess were over to tell you the truth the food wouldnt matter so much to me if life here were more pleasant in other ways but thats just it this tedious exis tence is starting to make us all disagreeable here are the opinions of the five grownup s on the present situation children arent allowed to have opinions and for once im s ticking to the rules mrs van daan id stopped wanting to be queen of the kitchen long ago but sitting around doing nothing was boring so i went back to cooking st ill i cant help complaining its impossible to cook without oil and all th ose disgusting smells make me sick to my stomach besides what do i get in return for my ef forts ingratitude and rude remarks im always the black sheep i get blamed for everything whats more its my opinion that the war is making very little progr ess the germans will win in the end im terrified that were going to starve and w hen im in a bad mood i snap at everyone who comes near mr van daan i just smoke and smoke and smoke then the food the political situation and kerlis moods dont seem so bad kerlis a swee theart if i dont have anything to smoke i get sick then i need to eat meat life bec omes unbearable nothings good enough and theres bound to be a flaming row my kerlis an idiot mrs frank foods not very important but id love a slice o f rye bread right now because im so hungry if i were mrs van daan id have put a st op to mr van daans smoking long ago but i desperately need a cigarette n ow because my heads in such a whirl the van daans are horrible people the englis h may make a lot of mistakes but the war is progressing i should keep my mouth s hut and be grateful im not in poland mr frank everythings fine i dont need a thing stay cal m weve got plenty of time just give me my potatoes and ill be quiet better set a side some of my rations for bep the political situation is improving im extremel y optimistic mr dussel i must complete the task ive set for myself eve rything must be finished on time the political situation is looking gut its eem possible for us to get caught me me me yours anne thursday march 16 1944 dearest kitty whew released from the gloom and doom for a few moments all i ve been hearing today is if this and that happens were in trouble and if s oandso gets sick well be left to fend for ourselves and if well you know the rest or at any rate i assume youre famthar enough with the residents of the annex to guess what theyd be talking about the reason for all the ifs is that mr kugler has been called up for a sixday work detail bep is down with a bad cold and will probably have to st ay home tomorrow miep hasnt gotten over her flu and mr kleimans stom ach b led so much he lost consciousness what a tale of woe we think mr kugler should go directly to a reliable doctor fo r a medical certificate of ill health which he can present to the city hall in hilversum the warehouse employees have been given a day off tomorrow so bep will be al one in the office if theres another if bep has to stay home the door will rem ain locked and well have to be as quiet as mice so the keg company wont hear us at one o clock jan will come for half an hour to check on us poor forsaken souls like a zookeeper this afternoon for the first time in ages jan gave us some ne ws of the outside world you should have seen us gathered around him it looked exactly like a print at grandmothers knee he regaled his grateful audience with talk ofwhat elsefo od mrs p a friend of mieps has been cooking his meals the day before yesterday jan ate carrots with green peas yesterday he had the leftovers today shes cook ing marrowfat peas and tomorrow shes plan ning to mash the remaining carrots with potatoes we asked about mieps doctor doctor said jan what doctor i called him this morning a nd got his secretary on the line i asked for a flu prescription and was told i could co me pick it up tomor row morning between eight and nine if youve got a particula rly bad case of flu the doctor himself comes to the phone and says stick out your to ngue and say aah oh i can hear it your throats infected ill write out a pre scription and you can bring it to the phar macy good day and thats that easy job hes got diagnosis by phone but i shouldnt blame the doctors after all a perso n has only two hands and these days therere too many patients and too few doctors still we all had a good laugh at jans phone call i can just im agine what a doctors waiting room looks like these days doctors no longer turn up their noses at the poorer patients but at those with minor illnesses hey wh at are you doing here they think go to the end of the line real patients have prio rity yours anne thursday march 16 1944 dearest kitty the weather is gorgeous indescribably beautiful ill be g oing up to the attic in a moment i now know why im so much more restless than peter he has his o wn room where he can work dream think and sleep im constantly being cha sed from one corner to another im never alone in the room i share with dussel thou gh i long to be so much thats another reason i take refuge in the attic when i m there or with you i can be myself at least for a little while still i dont want to moan and groan on the contrary i want to be brave thank goodness the others notice nothing of my innermost fee lings except that every day im growing cooler and more contemptuous of mother less affection ate to father and less willing to share a single thought with margot im closed up tighter than a drum above all i have to maintain my air of confidence no one must know that my heart and mind are constantly at war with each other u p to now reason has always won the battle but will my emotions get the upper hand sometimes i fear they will but more often i actually hope they do oh its so terribly hard not to talk to peter about these thin gs but i know i have to let him begin its so hard to act during the daytime as if ever ything ive said and done in my dreams had never taken place kitty anne is crazy but then these are crazy times and even crazier circumstances the nicest part is being able to write down all my thoughts and feelings otherwise id absolutely suffocate i wonder what peter thinks about a ll these things i keep thinking ill be able to talk to him about them one day he must have guessed something about the inner me since he couldnt possibly lov e the outer anne hes known so far how could someone like peter who loves peace an d quiet possibly stand my bustle and noise will he be the first and only person to see whats beneath my granite mask will it take him long isnt there some old sa ying about love being akin to pity isnt that whats happening here as well becau se i often pity him as much as i do myself i honestly dont know how to begin i really dont so how can i expect peter to when talking is so much harder for him if only i could write to him then at least hed know what i was trying to say since its so hard to say it out lo ud yours anne m frank friday march 17 1944 my dearest darling everything turned out all right after all bep just had a sore throat not the flu and mr kugler got a medical certificate to excuse him from the wo rk detail the entire annex breathed a huge sigh of relief everythings fine here except that margot and i are rather tired of our parents dont get me wrong i still love father as much as ever and marg ot loves both father and mother but when youre as old as we are you want to make a f ew decisions for yourself get out from under their thumb whenever i go upsta irs they ask what im going to do they wont let me salt my food mother asks me ever y evening at eightfifteen if it isnt time for me to change into my nighty i and they have to approve every book i read i must admit theyre not at all str ict about that and let me read nearly everything but margot and i are sick and tired of having to listen to their comments and questions all day long theres something else that displeases them i no longer fee l like giving them little kisses morning noon and night all those cute nicknames see m so affected and fathers fondness for talking about farting and going to the bathroom is disgusting in short id like nothing better than to do without their compa ny for a while and they dont understand that not that margot and i have ever said an y of this to them what would be the point they wouldnt understand anyway margot said last night what really bothers me is that if you happen to put your head in your hands and sigh once or twice they immediately ask whe ther you have a headache or dont feel well for both of us its been quite a blow to suddenly realize that very little remains of the close and harmoni ous family we used to have at home this is mostly because everythings out of kilter here by that i mean that were tre ated like children when it comes to external matters while inwardly were much olde r than other girls our age even though im only fourteen i know what i want i know whos right and whos wrong i have my own opinions ideas and principles and thou gh it may sound odd coming from a teenager i feel im more of a person than a child i feel im completely independent of others i know im better at debat ing or carrying on a discussion than mother i know im more objective i dont ex aggerate as much im much tidier and better with my hands and because of that i fee l this may make you laugh that im superior to her in many ways to love someone i have to admire and respect the person but i feel neither respect nor admiratio n for mother everything would be all right if only i had peter since i admi re him in many ways hes so decent and clever yours anne m frank saturday march 18 1944 dearest kitty ive told you more about myself and my feelings than ive ever told a living soul so why shouldnt that include sex parents and people in general are very peculiar when it com es to sex instead of telling their sons and daughters everything at the age of twe lve they send the children out of the room the moment the subject arises and lea ve them to find out everything on their own later on when parents notice that t heir children have somehow come by their information they assume they know mo re or less than they actually do so why dont they try to make amends by asking the m whats what a major stumbling block for the adults though in my opinion its no more than a pebble is that theyre afraid their children will no longe r look upon marriage as sacred and pure once they realize that in most cases this pu rity is a lot of nonsense as far as im concerned its not wrong for a man to bring a litt le experience to a marriage after all it has nothing to do with the marriage it self does it soon after i turned eleven they told me about menstruation but even then i had no idea where the blood came from or what it was for when i was twe lve and a half i learned some more from jacque who wasnt as ignorant as i was my own intuition told me what a man and a woman do when theyre together it seem ed like a crazy idea at first but when jacque confirmed it i was proud of mys elf for having figured it out it was also jacque who told me that children didnt come out of their mothers tummies as she put it where the ingredients go in is where t he finished product comes out jacque and i found out about the hymen and quite a few other details from a book on sex education i also knew that you could keep fr om having children but how that worked inside your body remained a mystery when i came here father told me about prostitutes etc but all in all there are stil l unanswered questions if mothers dont tell their children everything they hear i t in bits and pieces and that cant be right even though its saturday im not bored thats because iv e been up in the attic with peter i sat there dreaming with my eyes closed and it was won derful yours anne m frank sunday march 19 1944 dearest kitty yesterday was a very important day for me after lunch everyt hing was as usual at five i put on the potatoes and mother gave me some blood sausa ge to take to peter i didnt want to at first but i finally went he wouldnt acce pt the sausage and i had the dreadful feel ing it was still because of that argument w ed had about distrust suddenly i couldnt bear it a moment longer and my eyes filled with tears without another word i re turned the platter to mother and went to th e bathroom to have a good cry afterward i decided to talk things out with peter b efore dinner the four of us were helping him with a crossword puzzle so i couldnt say anything but as we were sitting down to eat i whispered to him are you going to practice your shorthand tonight peter no was his reply id like to talk to you later on he agreed after the dishes were done i went to his room and asked if hed refused the sausage because of our last quar rel luckily that wasnt the reaso n he just thought it was bad manners to seem so eager it had been very hot downstairs a nd my face was as red as a lobster so after taking down some water for margot i went back up to get a little fresh air for the sake of appearances i first went a nd stood beside the van daans window before going to peters room he was standing o n the left side of the open window so i went over to the right side its much easier to talk next to an open window in semidarkness than in broad daylight and i thi nk peter felt the same way we told each other so much so very much that i cant repe at it all but it felt good it was the most won derful evening ive ever had in the a nnex ill give you a brief description of the various subjects we touched on first we talked about the quarrels and how i see them in a very d ifferent light these days and then about how weve become alienated from our pare nts i told peter about mother and father and margot and myself at one point he asked you always give each other a goodnight kiss dont you one dozens of them you dont do you no ive never really kissed anyone not even on your birthday yeah on my birthday i have we talked about how neither of us really trusts our parents a nd how his parents love each other a great deal and wish hed confide in them but that he doesnt want to how i cry my heart out in bed and he goes up to the loft and swears how margot and i have only recently gotten to know each other and yet stil l tell each other very little since were always together we talked about every i maginable thing about trust feelings and ourselves oh kitty he was just as i tho ught he would be then we talked about the year 1942 and how different we were b ack then we dont even recognize ourselves from that period how we couldnt s tand each other at first hed thought i was a noisy pest and id quickly concluded tha t he was nothing special i didnt understand why he didnt flirt with me but now im gl ad he also mentioned how he often used to retreat to his room i said that my noise an d exuberance and his silence were two sides of the same coin and that i also liked p eace and quiet but dont have anything for myself alone except my diary and th at everyone would rather see the back of me starting with mr dussel and that i dont a lways want to sit with my parents we discussed how glad he is that my parents have ch ildren and how glad i am that hes here how i now understand his need to withdraw and his relationshi p to his parents and how much id like to help him when they argue but youre always a help to me he said how i asked greatly surprised by being cheerful that was the nicest thing he said all evening he also told me t hat he didnt mind my coming to his room the way he used to in fact he liked it i als o told him that all of fathers and mothers pet names were meaningless that a kis s here and there didnt automatically lead to trust we also talked about doing thin gs your own way the diary loneliness the difference between everyones inner and ou ter selves my mask etc it was wonderful he must have come to love me as a friend and for the time being thats enough im so grateful and happy i cant find the wor ds i must apolo gize kitty since my style is not up to my usual standard today iv e just written whatever came into my head i have the feeling that peter and i share a secret whenever he looks at me with those eyes with that smile and that wink its as if a light go es on inside me i hope things will stay like this and that well have many many more happy hours together your grateful and happy anne monday march 20 1944 dearest kitty this morning peter asked me if id come again one evening he s wore i wouldnt be disturbing him and said that where there was room for one th ere was room for two i said i couldnt see him every evening since my parents didn t think it was a good idea but he thought i shouldnt let that bother me so i told h im id like to come some saturday evening and also asked him if hed let me know wh en you could see the moon sure he said maybe we can go downstairs and look at the mo on from there i agreed im not really so scared of burglars in the meantime a shadow has fallen on my happiness for a lon g time ive had the feeling that margot likes peter just how much i dont know b ut the whole situation is very unpleasant now every time i go see peter im hurting her without meaning to the funny thing is that she hardly lets it show i know id be in sanely jealous but margot just says i shouldnt feel sorry for her i think its so awful that youve become the odd one out i ad ded im used to that she replied somewhat bitterly i dont dare tell peter maybe later on but he and i need to dis cuss so many other things first mother slapped me last night which i deserved i mustnt car ry my indifference and contempt for her too far in spite of everything i should try once again to be friendly and keep my remarks to myself even pim isnt as nice as he used to be hes been trying not to t reat me like a child but now hes much too cold well just have to see what comes of it hes warned me that if i dont do my algebra i wont get any tutoring after th e war i could simply wait and see what happens but id like to start again provid ed i get a new book thats enough for now i do nothing but gaze at peter and im f illed to overflowing yours anne m frank evidence of margots goodness i received this today march 20 1944 anne yesterday when i said i wasnt jeal ous of you i wasnt being entirely honest the situation is this im not jealous of either you or peter im just sorry i havent found anyone willi whom to share my thoughts and feelings an d im not likely to in the near future but thats why i wish from the bottom of my he art that you will both be able to place your trust in each other youre already missing out on so much here things other people take for granted on the other hand im certain id never have gotten as far wit h peter because i think id need to feel very close to a person before i could share my t houghts id want to have the feeling that he understood me through and through e ven if i didnt say much for this reason it would have to be someone i felt was intellec tually superior to me and that isnt the case with peter but i can imagine your feel ing close to him so theres no need for you to reproach yourself because you th ink you te taking something i was entitled to nothing could be further from th e truth you and peter have everything to gain by your friendship my answer dearest margot your letter was extremely kind but i still dont feel comple tely happy about the situation and i dont think i ever will at the moment peter and i dont trust each other as much as you seem to think its just that when youre standing beside an open window at twthg ht you can say more to each other than in bright sunshine its also easier to whisp er your feelings than to shout them from the rooftops i think youve begun to feel a ki nd of sisterly affection for peter and would like to help him just as much as i would pe rhaps youll be able to do that someday though thats not the kind of trust we have in mind i believe that trust has to corne from both sides i also think thats the rea son why father and i have never really grown so close but lets not talk about it a nymore if theres anything you still want to discuss please write because it s easier for me to say what i mean as on paper than facetoface you know how le much i adm ire you and only hope that some of your goodness and fathers goodness will ru b off on me because in that sense you two are a lot alike yours anne wednesday march 221944 dearest kitty i received this letter last night from margot dear anne after your letter of yesterday i have the unpleasant feeling that your conscience bothers you whenever you go to peters to work or talk there s really no reason for that in my heart i know theres someone who deserves t my tru st as i do his and i wouldnt be able to tolerate peter in his place however as you wrote i do think of peter as a kind of brother a younger brother weve been sending out feelers and a brotherly and sisterly affection mayor may not develop at some later date but its certainly not rea ched that stage yet so theres no need for you to feel sorry for me now that youve fo und companionship enjoy it as much as you can in the meantime things are getting more and more wonderful h ere i think kitty that true love may be developing in the annex all those jokes abou t marrying peter if we stayed here long enough werent so silly after all not that i m thinking of marrying him mind you i dont even know what hell be like when he grow s up or if well even love each other enough to get married im sure now that peter loves me too i just dont know in what w ay i cant figure out if he wants only a good friend or if hes attracted to me as a girl or as a sister when he said i always helped him when his parents were arguing i was tremendously happy it was one step toward making me believe in his friends hip i asked him yesterday what hed do if there were a dozen annes who kept pop ping in to see him his answer was if they were all like you it wouldnt be so ba d hes extremely hospitable and i think he really likes to see me mean while hes been working hard at learning french even studying in bed until tenfifteen oh when i think back to saturday night to our words our voic es i feel satisfied with myself for the very first time what i mean is id still say th e same and wouldnt want to change a thing the way i usually do hes so handsome whether hes smthng or just sitting still hes so sweet and good and beautiful i think what surprised him most about me was when he discovered that im not at all the sup erficial worldly anne i appear to be but a dreamer like he is with just as many troubles last night after the dinner dishes i waited for him to ask me t o stay upstairs but nothing happened i went away he came downstairs to tell dus sel it was time to listen to the radio and hung around the bathroom for a while b ut when dussel took too long he went back upstairs he paced up and down his room a nd went to bed early the entire evening i was so restless i kept going to the bathro om to splash cold water on my face i read a bit daydreamed some more looked at the clock and waited waited waited all the while listening to his foot steps i went to bed early exhausted tonight i have to take a bath and tomorrow tomorrows so far away yours anne m frank my answer dearest margot i think the best thing is simply to wait and see what happens i t cant be much longer before peter and i will have to decide whether to go back to the way we were or do some thing else i dont know how itll turn out i cant see a ny farther than the end of my nose but im certain of one thing if peter and i do become friends im going to tell him youre also very fond of him and are prepared to help him if he n eeds you you wouldnt want me to im sure but i dont care i dont know wh at peter thinks of you but ill ask him when the time comes its certainly noth ing bad on the contrary youre welcome to join us in the attic or wherever we are you wont be disturbing us because we have an unspoken agreement to talk only in the evenings when its dark keep your spirits up im doing my best though its not alway s easy your time may come sooner than you think yours anne thursday march 23 1944 dearest kitty things are more or less back to normal here our coupon men hav e been released from prison thank goodness mieps been back since yesterday but today it was her husban ds turn to take to his bedchills and fever the usual flu symptoms bep is better though she still has a cough and mr kleiman will have to stay home for a long time yesterday a plane crashed nearby the crew was able to parach ute out in time it crashed on top of a school but luckily there were no children inside there was a small fire and a couple of people were killed as the airmen ma de their descent the germans sprayed them with bullets the amsterdammers who sa w it seethed with rage at such a dastardly deed weby which i mean the ladiesw ere also scared out of our wits brrr i hate the sound of gunfire now about myself i was with peter yesterday and somehow i honestly dont kno w how we wound up talking about sex id made up my mind a long time ago to ask him a few things he knows everything when i said that margot and i werent very w ell informed he was amazed i told him a lot about margot and me and mother and fath er and said that lately i didnt dare ask them anything he offered to enlight en me and i gratefully accepted he described how contraceptives work and i asked him very boldly how boys could tell they were grown up he had to think about that o ne he said hed tell me tonight i told him what had happened to jacque and said th at girls are defenseless against strong boys well you dont have to be afraid of me he said when i came back that evening he told me how it is with boys sl ightly embarrassing but still awfully nice to be able to discuss it with him neith er he nor i had ever imagined wed be able to talk so openly to a girl or a boy respe ctively about such intimate matters i think i know everything now he told me a l ot about what he called prasentivmitteln should be praservativmitteln prophylactics in german that night in the bathroom margot and i were talking about bra m and trees two friends of hers this morning i was in for a nasty surprise after breakfast pe ter beckoned me upstairs that was a dirty trick you played on me he said i heard what you and margot were saying in the bathroom last night i think you jus t wanted to find out how much peter knew and then have a good laugh i was stunned i did everything i could to talk him out of that o utrageous idea i could understand how he must have felt but it just wasnt tru e oh no peter i said id never be so mean i told you i would nt pass on anything you said to me and i wont to put on an act like that and then del iberately be so mean nopeter thats not my idea ofa joke it wouldnt be fair i didnt say anything honest wont you believe me he assured me he did but i think well have to talk about it again sometim e ive done nothing all day but worry about it thank goodness he came right out and sa id what was on his mind imagine if hed gone around thinking i could be that mea n hes so sweet now ill have to tell him everything yours anne friday march 24 1944 dear kitty i often go up to peters room after dinner nowadays to breathe in the fresh evening air you can get around to meaningful conversations more qui ckly in the dark than with the sun tickling your face its cozy and snug sitting beside him on a chair and looking outside the van daans and dussel make the silliest remarks w hen i disappear into his room annes zweite heimat annes second home they sa y or is it proper for a gentleman to receive young girls in his room at night with th e lights out peter has amazing presence of mind in the face of these socalled witti cisms my mother incidentally is also bursting with curiosity and simply dy ing to ask what we talk about only shes secretly afraid id refuse to answer pete r says the grownups are just jealous because were young and that we shouldnt take t heir obnoxious comments to heart sometimes he comes downstairs to get me but thats awkward t oo because in spite of all his precautions his face turns bright red and he can har dly get the words out of his mouth im glad i dont blush it must be extremely unplea sant besides it bothers me that margot has to sit downstairs all b y herself while im upstairs enjoying peters company but what can i do about it i wouldnt mind it if she came but shed just be the odd one out sitting there like a lump on a log ive had to listen to countless remarks about our sudden frie ndship i cant tell you how often the conversation at meals has been about an annex we dding should the war last another five years do we take any notice of this parenta l chitchat hardly since its all so silly have my parents forgotten that they were yo ung once apparently they have at any rate they laugh at us when were serious an d theyre serious when were joking i dont know whats going to happen next or whether well run out of things to say but if it goes on like this well eventually be able to be toge ther without talking if only his parents would stop acting so strangely its probab ly because they dont like seeing me so often peter and i certainly never tell them what we talk about imagine if they knew we were discussing such intimate things id like to ask peter whether he knows what girls look like dow n there i dont think boys are as complicated as girls you can easily see what boys look like in photographs or pictures of male nudes but with women its di fferent in women the genitals or whatever theyre called are hidden between th eir legs peter has probably never seen a girl up close to tell you the truth neither have i boys are a lot easier how on earth would i go about describing a girls parts i can t ell from what he said that he doesnt know exactly how it all fits together he was t alking about the muttermund cervix but thats on the inside where yo u cant see it everythings pretty well arranged in us women until i was eleven or twelve i didnt realize there was a second set of labia on the inside since you couldnt see them whats even funnier is that i thought urine came out of the clitoris i ask ed mother one time what that little bump was and she said she didnt know she can rea lly play dumb when she wants to but to get back to the subject how on earth can you explain wha t it all looks like without any models shall i try anyway okay here goes when youre standing up all you see from the front is hair be tween your legs there are two soft cushiony things also covered with hair which press together when youre standing so you cant see whats inside they separa te when you sit down and theyre very red and quite fleshy on the inside in the upper p art between the outer labia theres a fold of skin that on second thought looks l ike a kind of blister thats the clitoris then come the inner labia which are also press ed together in a kind of crease when they open up you can see a fleshy little mound n o bigger than the top of my thumb the upper part has a couple of small holes in it wh ich is where the urine comes out the lower part looks as if it were just skin a nd yet thats where the vagina is you can barely find it because the folds of ski n hide the opening the holes so small i can hardly imagine how a man could get in ther e much less how a baby could come out its hard enough trying to get your index finger inside thats all there is and yet it plays such an important role yours anne m frank saturday march 25 1944 dearest kitty you never realize how much youve changed until after its ha ppened ive changed quite drastically everything about me is different my opi nions ideas critical outlook inwardly outwardly nothings the same and i might safel y add since its true ive changed for the better i once told you that after years of be ing adored it was hard for me to adjust to the harsh reality of grownups and rebukes but father and mother are largely to blame for my having to put up with so much at home they wanted me to enjoy life which was fine but here they shouldn t have encouraged me to agree with them and only shown me their side of all the qua rrels and gossip it was a long time before i discovered the score was fiftyfifty i now know that many blunders have been committed here by young and old alike fa ther and mothers biggest mistake in dealing with the van daans is that theyre never candid and friendly admittedly the friendliness might have to be feigned ab ove all i want to keep the peace and to neither quarrel nor gossip with father and mar got thats not difficult but it is with mother which is why im glad she gives me an occa sional rap on the knuckles you can win mr van daan to your side by agreeing wit h him listening quietly not saying much and most of all responding to his teasing and his corny jokes with a joke of your own mrs van d can be won over by talk ing openly to her and admitting when youre wrong she also frankly admits her faults of which she has many i know all too well that she doesnt think as badly of me a s she did in the beginning and thats simply because im honest and tell peo ple right to their faces what i think even when its not very flattering i want to be h onest i think it gets you further and also makes you feel better about yourself yesterday mrs van d was talking about the rice we gave mr kl eiman all we do is give give give but at a certain point i think that enough is enough if hed only take the trouble mr kleiman could scrounge up his own rice why s hould we give away all our supplies we need them just as badly no mrs van daan i replied i dont agree with you mr kl eiman may very well be able to get hold of a little rice but he doesnt like having to worry about it its not our place to criticize the people who are helping us we shoul d give them whatever they need if we can possibly spare it one less plate of rice a w eek wont make that much difference we can always eat beans mrs van d didnt see it my way but she added that even thoug h she disagreed she was willing to back down and that was an entirely different m atter well ive said enough sometimes i know what my place is and s ometimes i have my doubts but ill eventually get where i want to be i know i wil l especially now that i have help since peter helps me through many a rough patch and rainy day i honestly dont know how much he loves me and whether well ev er get as far as a kiss in any case i dont want to force the issue i told fathe r i often go see peter and asked if he approved and of course he did its much easier now to tell peter things id nor mally keep t o myself for example i told him i want to write later on and if i cant be a writer to write in addition to my work i dont have much in the way of money or worldly possessions i m not beautiful intelligent or clever but im happy and i intend to stay tha t way i was born happy i love people i have a trusting nature and id like everyone e lse to be happy too your devoted friend anne m frank an empty day though clear and bright is just as dark as any night i wrote this a few weeks ago and it no longer holds true but i i ncluded it because my poems are so few and far between monday march 27 1944 dearest kitty at least one long chapter on our life in hiding should be about politics but ive been avoiding the subject since it interests me so little today however ill devote an entire letter to politics of course there are many different opinions on this topic a nd its not surprising to hear it frequently discussed in times of war but arguing so much about politics is just plain stupid let them laugh swear make bets grumble and do whatever they want as long as they stew in their own juice but dont let them argue since that only makes things worse the people who come from outside bring us a lot of news that later proves to be untrue however up to now our radio has nev er lied jan miep mr kleiman bep and mr kugler go up and down in their political m oods though jan least of all here in the annex the mood never varies the end less debates over the invasion air raids speeches etc etc are accompanied by countle ss exclamations such as eempossible urn gottes willen oh for heavens sake if theyre just getting started now how long is it going to last its going splendi dly but great optimists and pessimists not to mention the realists ai r their opinions with unflagging energy and as with everything else theyre all certain that they have a monopoly on the truth it annoys a certain lady that her spous e has such supreme faith in the british and a certain husband attacks his wife b ecause of her teasing and dispar aging remarks about his beloved nation and so it goes from early in the morning to late at night the fu nny part is that they never get tired of it ive discovered a trick and the effect is overwhelming just like pricking someone with a pin and watching them jump heres ho w it works i start talking about politics all it takes is a single question a word or a sentence and bef ore you know it the entire family is involved as if the german wehrmacht news and the english bbc werent enough theyve now added special airraid announcements in a word splend id but the other side of the coin is that the british air force is operating around the clock not unlike the german propaganda machine which is cranking out lies twent yfour hours a day so the radio is switched on every morning at eight if not earl ier and is listened to every hour until nine ten or even eleven at night this is the best evidence yet that the adults have infinite patience but also that their brain s have turned to mush some of them i mean since i wouldnt want to insult anyone one b roadcast two at the most should be enough to last the entire day but no those ol d nincompoops never mind ive already said it all music while you work the dutch broadcast from england frank phillips or queen wilhelmina they each get a turn and find a willing listener if the adults arent eating or sleeping t heyre clustered around the radio talking about eating sleeping and politics whew it s getting to be a bore and its all i can do to keep from turning into a dreary old crone my self though with all the old folks around me that might not be such a bad idea heres a shining example a speech made by our beloved winsto n churchill nine oclock sunday evening the teapot under its cozy is on the table and the guests enter the room dussel sits to the left of the radio mr van d in front of it an d peter to the side mother is next to mr van d willi mrs van d behind them mar got and i are sitting in the last row and pim at the table i realize this isnt a very clear description of our seating arrangements but it doesnt matter the men smoke peters eyes close from the strain of listening mama is dressed in her long dark neg ligee mrs van d is trembling because of the planes which take no notice of the s peech but fly blithely on toward essen father is slurping his tea and margot and i are united in a sisterly way by the sleeping mouschi who has taken possession of both our knees margots hair is in curlers and my nightgown is too small too tight and too sho rt it all looks so intimate cozy and peaceful and for once it really is yet i a wait the end of the speech willi dread theyre impatient straining at the lea sh to start another argument pst pst like a cat luring a mouse from its hole they goad eac h other into quarrels and dissent yours anne tuesday march 28 1944 my dearest kitty as much as id like to write more on politics i have lots of oth er news to report today first mother has virtually forbidden me to go up to pe ters since according to her mrs van daan is jealous second peters invited margo t to join us upstairs whether he really means it or is just saying it out of politene ss i dont know third i asked father if he thought i should take any notice of mrs va n daans jealousy and he said i didnt have to what should i do now mothers angry doesnt want me going up stairs wants me to go back to doing my homework in the room i share willi dussel s he may be jealous herself father doesnt begrudge us those few hours and thin ks its nice we get along so well margot likes peter too but feels that three people c ant talk about the same things as two furthermore mother thinks peters in love with me to tell y ou the truth i wish he were then wed be even and itd be a lot easier to get to know e ach other she also claims hes always looking at me well i suppose we do give ea ch other the occasional wink but i cant help it if he keeps admiring my di mples can i im in a very difficult position mothers against me and im against her father turns a blind eye to the silent struggle between mother and me mothe r is sad because she still loves me but im not at all unhappy because she no long er means anything to me as for peter i dont want to give him up hes so sweet and i a dmire him so much he and i could have a really beautiful relationship so why are the old folks poking their noses into our business again fortu nately i m used to hiding my feelings so i manage not to show how crazy i am about him is he ever going to say anything am i ever going to feel his cheek against mine the w ay i felt petels cheek in my dream oh peter and petel youre one and the same they dont understand us the yd never understand that were content just to sit beside each other and not say a w ord they have no idea of what draws us together oh when will we overcome all t hese difficulties and yet its good that we have to surmount them since it makes the end that much more beautiful when he lays his head on his arms and closes his eye s hes still a child when he plays with mouschi or talks about her hes loving wh en he carries the potatoes or other heavy loads hes strong when he goes to wa tch the gunfire or walks through the dark house to look for burglars hes brave and when hes so awkward and clumsy hes hopelessly endearing its much ni cer when he explains something to me than when i have to teach him i wish he were sup erior to me in nearly every way what do we care about our two mothers oh if only hed say some thing father always says im conceited but im not im merely vai n i havent had many people tell me i was pretty except for a boy at school who said i looked so cute when i smiled yesterday peter paid me a true com pliment an d just for fun ill give you a rough idea of our conversation peter often says smile i thought it was strange so yeste rday i asked him why do you always want me to smile because you get dimples in your cheeks how do you do that i was born with them theres also one in my chin its the onl y mark of beauty i possess no no thats not true yes it is i know im not beautiful i never have been and i nev er will be i dont agree i think youre pretty i am not i say you are and youll have to take my word for it so of cou rse i then said the same about him yours anne m frank wednesday march 29 1944 dearest kitty mr bolkestein the cabinet minister speaking on the dutch broadcast from london said that after the war a collection would be made of diaries a nd letters dealing with the war of course everyone pounced on my diary just imagin e how interesting it would be if i were to publish a novel about the secret annex th e title alone would make people think it was a detective story seriously though ten years after the war people would find it very amusing to read how we lived what we ate and what we talked about as jews in hid ing although i tell you a great deal about our lives you still know very litt le about us how frightened the women are during air raids last sunday for i nstance when 350 british planes dropped 550 tons of bombs on ijmuiden so that the hous es trembled like blades of grass in the wind or how many epidemics are raging h ere you know nothing of these matters and it would take me all day to describe everything down to the last detail people have to stand in li ne to buy vegetables and all kinds of goods doctors cant visit their patients sinc e their cars and bikes are stolen the moment they turn their backs burglaries and thef ts are so common that you ask yourself whats suddenly gotten into the dutch to make th em so lightfingered little children eight and eleven yearolds smash the wi ndows of peoples homes and steal whatever they can lay their hands on people dont d are leave the house for even five minutes since theyre liable to come back and find all their belongings gone every day the newspapers are filled with reward notices for t he return of stolen typewriters persian rugs electric clocks fabrics etc the electric clocks on street corners are dismantled public phones are stripped down to t he last wire morale among the dutch cant be good everyones hungry exc ept for the ersatz coffee a weeks food ration doesnt last two days the invas ions long in coming the men are being shipped off to germany the children are sick or undernourished everyones wearing wornout clothes and rundown shoes a n ew sole costs 750 guil ders on the black market besides few shoemakers will do repairs or if they do you have to wait four months for your shoes which might ve ry well have disappeared in the meantime one good thing has come out of this as the food gets worse and t he decrees more severe the acts of sabo tage against the authorities are in creasing the ration board the police the officialstheyre all either helping their fellow citizens or denouncing them and sending them off to prison fortunately only a smal l percentage of dutch people are on the wrong side yours anne friday march 31 1944 dearest kitty just imagine its still fairly cold and yet most people hav e been without coal for nearly a month sounds awful doesnt it theres a general m ood of optimism about the russian front because thats going great guns i dont o ften write about the political situation but i must tell you where the russians a re at the moment theyve reached the polish border and the prut river in romania they re close to odessa and theyve surrounded ternopol every night were expecting a n extra communique from stalin theyre firing off so many salutes in moscow the city must be rumbling and shaking all day long whether they like to pretend the fightings nea rby or they simply dont have any other way to express their joy i dont know hungary has been occupied by german troops there are still a million jews living there they too are doom ed nothing special is happening here today is mr van daans bi rthday he received two packets of tobacco one serving of coffee which his wife had managed to save lemon punch from mr kugler sardines from miep eau de cologne fro m us lilacs tulips and last but not least a cake with raspberry filling slightly g luey because of the poor quality of the flour and the lack of butter but deli cious an yway all that talk about peter and me has died down a bit hes comin g to pick me up tonight pretty nice of him dont you think since he hates d oing it were very good friends we spend a lot of time together and talk about every i maginable subject its so nice not having to hold back when we come to a delicate topic the way i would with other boys for example we were talking about blood and somehow the conversation turned to menstruation etc he thinks we wome n are quite tough to be able to withstand the loss of blood and that i am too i wonder why my life here has gotten better much better god has not forsa ken me and he never will yours anne m frank saturday april 1 1944 my dearest kitty and yet everything is still so difficult you do know what i me an dont you i long so much for him to kiss me but that kiss is taking its own sweet ti me does he still think of me as a friend dont i mean anything more you and i both know that im strong that i can carry most burde ns alone ive never been used to sharing my worries with anyone and ive never cl ung to a mother but id love to lay my head on his shoulder and just sit there quiet ly i cant i simply cant forget that dream of peters cheek wh en everything was so good does he have the same longing is he just too shy to say he loves me why does he want me near him so much oh why doesnt he say somethi ng ive got to stop ive got to be calm ill try to be strong agai n and if im patient the rest will follow but and this is the worst part i seem to b e chasing him im always the one who has to go upstairs he never comes to me but thats because of the rooms and he understands why i object oh im sure he und erstands more than i think yours anne m frank monday april 3 1944 my dearest kitty contrary to my usual practice im going to write you a detail ed description of the food situation since its become a matter of some difficult y and importance not only here in the annex but in all of holland all of europe and even beyond in the twentyone months weve lived here weve been throug h a good many food cycles youll understand what that means in a moment a f ood cycle is a period in which we have only one particular dish or type of vegetable to eat for a long time we ate nothing but endive endive with sand endive without s and endive with mashed potatoes endiveandmashed potato casserole then it was spinach followed by kohlrabi salsify cucumbers tomatoes sauerkraut etc etc its not much fun when you have to eat say sauer kraut every day for lunch and dinner but when youre hungry enough you do a lot of things now however were going through the most delightful period so far because the re are no vegetables at all our weekly lunch menu consists of brown beans splitpea sou p potatoes with dumplings potato kugel and by the grace of god turnip gree ns or rotten carrots and then its back to brown beans because of the bread shortage we eat potatoes at every meal starting with breakfast but then we fry them a li ttle to make soup we use brown beans navy beans potatoes packages of vege tab le soup packages of chicken soup and packages of bean soup there are brown beans in everything including the bread for dinner we always have potatoes with imitation gravy and thank goodness weve still got it beet salad i must tell yo u about the dumplings we make them with governmentissue flour water and yeast t heyre so gluey and tough that it feels as if you had rocks in your stomach but oh w ell the high point is our weekly slice of liverwurst and the jam o n our unbuttered bread but were still alive and much of the time it still tastes goo d too yours anne m frank wednesday april 5 1944 my dearest kitty for a long time now i didnt know why i was bothering to do any sc hoolwork the end of the war still seemed so far away so unreal like a fairy tale if the war isnt over by september i wont go back to school since i dont wan t to be two years behind peter filled my days nothing but peter dreams and thoughts until saturday night when i felt so utterly miserable oh it was awful i held back my tears when i was with peter laughed uproariously with the van daans as we dra nk lemon punch and was cheerful and excited but the minute i was alone i knew i was go ing to cry my eyes out i slid to the floor in my nightgown and began by saying my p rayers very fervently then i drew my knees to my chest lay my head on my ar ms and cried all huddled up on the bare floor a loud sob brought me back down to earth and i choked back my tears since i didnt want anyone next door to hear me then i tried to pull myself together saying over and over i must i must i must stiff from sitting in such an unusual position i fell back against the side of th e bed and kept up my struggle until just before tenthirty when i climbed back i nto bed it was over and now its really over i finally realized that i must do my s choolwork to keep from being ignorant to get on in life to become a journalist bec ause thats what i want i know i can write a few of my stories are good my descriptions of the secret annex are humorous much of my diary is vivid and alive but it re mains to be seen whether i really have talent evas dream is my best fairy tale and the odd thing is that i dont have the faintest idea where it came from parts of cadys life are also good but as a whole its nothing special im my best and harshest critic i know what s good and what isnt unless you write yourself you cant know how wonderful it is i always used to bemoan the fact that i couldnt draw but now im overjoyed th at at least i can write and if i dont have the talent to write books or newspaper arti cles i can always write for myself but i want to achieve more than that i cant imagi ne having to live like mother mrs van daan and all the women who go about their work and are then forgotten i need to have something besides a husband and chi ldren to devote myself to i dont want to have lived in vain like most people i want t o be useful or bring enjoyment to all people even those ive never met i want to g o on living even after my death and thats why im so grateful to god for having give n me this gift which i can use to develop myself and to express all thats inside me when i write i can shake off all my cares my sor row disappear s my spirits are revived but and thats a big question will i ever be able to write something great will i ever become a journalist or a writer i hope so oh i hope so very much because writing allows me to record everything all my thoughts ideals and fantasies i havent worked on cadys life for ages in my mind ive wor ked out exactly what happens next but the story doesnt seem to be coming along ve ry well i might never finish it and itll wind up in the wastepaper basket or the st ove thats a horrible thought but then i say to myself at the age of fourteen and w ith so little experience you cant write about philosophy so onward and upward with renewed spirits itll all work ou t because im determined to write yours anne m frank thursday april 6 1944 dearest kitty you asked me what my hobbies and interests are and id like to a nswer but id better warn you i have lots of them so dont be surprised first of all writing but i dont really think of that as a hob by number two genealogical charts im looking in every newsp aper book and document i can find for the family trees of the french german spanish english austrian russian norwegian and dutch royal famthes ive made great progress with many of them because for a long time ive been taking notes while re ading biogra i phies or history books i even copy out many of the passages on histo ry so my third hobby is history and fathers already bought me n umerous books i can hardly wait for the day when ill be able to go to the public lib rary and ferret out iii the information i need number four is greek and roman mythology i have various book s on this subject too i can name the nine muses and the seven loves of zeus i have the wives of hercules etc etc down pat my other hobbies are movie stars and family photographs im crazy about reading and books i adore the history of the arts especially when it con cerns writers poets and painters musicians may come later i loathe algebra geome try and arithmetic i enjoy all my other school subjects but historys my favorite yours anne m frank tuesday april 11 1944 my dearest kitty my heads in a whirl i really dont know where to begin thurs day the last time i wrote you everything was as usual friday afternoon good f riday we played monopoly saturday afternoon too the days passed very quic kly around two oclock on saturday heavy firing ii beganmachine guns according to the men for the rest everything was quiet sunday afternoon peter came to see me at fourthirty at my in vitation at fivefifteen we went to the ii front attic where we stayed un til six there was a beautil ful mozart concert on the radio from six to sevenfif teen i especially enjoyed the kleine nachtmusik i can hardly bear to listen in the kitc hen since beautiful music stirs me to the very depths of my soul sunday evening peter co uldnt take his balli because the washtub was down in the office kitchen filled wi th laundry the two of us went to the front attic together and in order to be able to s it comfortably i took along the only cushion i could find in my room we seated ourse lves on a packing crate since both the crate and the cushion were very narrow we were sitting quite close leaning against two other crates mouschi kept us com pany so we werent without a chaperon suddenly at a quarter to nine mr van da an whistled and asked if we had mr dussels cushion we jumped up and went downstairs willi the cushion the cat and mr van daan this cushion was the source of much miser y dussel was angry because id taken the one he uses as a pillow and he was afraid it might be covered with fleas he had the entire house in an uproar because of thi s one cushion in revenge peter and i stuck two hard brushes in his bed but had to take them out again when dussel unexpectedly decided to go sit in his room we had a really good laugh at this little intermezzo but our fun was shortlived at ninethirty peter knocked ge ntly on the door and asked father to come upstairs and help him with a difficult en glish sentence that sounds fishy i said to margot its obviously a pret ext you can tell by the way the men are talking that theres been a breakin i was ri ght the warehouse was being broken into at that very moment father mr van daa n and peter were downstairs in a flash margot mother mrs van d and i waite d four frightened women need to talk so thats what we did until we heard a bang d ownstairs after that all was quiet the clock struck quarter to ten the color had drained from our faces but we remained calm even though we were afraid wher e were the men what was that bang were they fighting with the burglars we were t oo scared to think all we could do was wait ten oclock footsteps on the stairs father pale and nervo us came inside followed by mr van daan lights out tiptoe upstairs were expecti ng the police there wasnt time to be scared the lights were switched off i grab bed a jacket and we sat down upstairs what happened tell us quickly there was no one to tell us the men had gone back downstairs t he four of them didnt come back up until ten past ten two of them kept watch a t peters open window the door to the landing was locked the book case shu t we draped a sweater over our nightlight and then they told us what had h appened peter was on the landing when he heard two loud bangs he went d ownstairs and saw that a large panel was missing from the left half of the wareho use door he dashed upstairs alerted the home guard and the four of them went downstairs when they entered the warehouse the burglars were going about their b usiness without thinking mr van daan yelled police hur ried footsteps outside t he burglars had fled the board was put back in the door so the police wouldnt notice th e gap but then a swift kick from outside sent it flying to the floor the men were ama zed at the burglars audacity both peter and mr van daan felt a murderous rage co me over them mr van daan slammed an ax against the floor and all was quiet again once more the panel was re placed and once more the attempt was foiled outside a man and a woman shone a glaring flashlight through the opening lighting up the entire warehouse what the mumbled one of the men but now their roles had been re versed instead of policemen they were now burglars all four of them raced ups tairs dussel and mr van daan snatched up dussels books peter opened the doors a nd windows in the kitchen and private office hurled the phone to the ground a nd the four of them finally ended up behind the bookcase end of part one in all probability the man and woman with the flashlight had a lerted the police it was sunday night easter sunday the next day easter monday th e office was going to be closed which meant we wouldnt be able to move around unti l tuesday morning think of it having to sit in such terror for a day and two night s we thought of nothing but simply sat there in pitch darkness in her fear mrs van d had switched off the lamp we whispered and every time we heard a creak someone said shh shh it was tenthirty then eleven not a sound father and mr va n daan took turns coming upstairs to us then at elevenfifteen a noise belo w up above you could hear the whole family breathing for the rest no one moved a m uscle footsteps in the house the private office the kitchen then on the st aircase all sounds of breathing stopped eight hearts pounded foot steps on the stairs then a rattling at the bookcase this moment is indescribable now were done for i said and i had visions of all fifteen o f us being dragged away by the gestapo that very night more rattling at the bookcase twice then we heard a can fall and the footsteps receded we were out of danger so far a shiver went though ev eryones body i heard several sets of teeth chattering no one said a word we stayed like this until eleventhirty there were no more sounds in the house but a light was shining on our landing right in front of the bookcase was that because the police thought it looked so suspicious or because they simply forgot was anyone going to come back a nd turn it off we found our tongues again there were no longer any people inside the building but perh aps someone was standing guard outside we then did three things tried to gu ess what was going on trembled with fear and went to the bathroom since the bucket s were in the attic all we had was peters metal wastepaper basket mr van daan went first then father but mother was too embarrassed father brought the waste ba sket to the next room where margot mrs van daan and i gratefully made use of it mo ther finally gave in there was a great demand for paper and luckily i had some in my pocket the wastebasket stank everything went on in a whisper and w e were exhausted it was midnight lie down on the floor and go to sleep margot and i were each g iven a pillow and a blanket margot lay down near the food cupboard and i made my bed between the table legs the smell wasnt quite so bad when you were lying o n the floor but mrs van daan quietly went and got some powdered bleach and draped a dish towel over the potty as a further precaution talk whispers fear stench farting and people continual ly going to the bathroom try sleeping through that by twothirty however i was so tire d i dozed off and didnt hear a thing until threethirty i woke up when mrs van d lay her head on my feet for heavens sake give me something to put on i said i was handed some clothes but dont ask what a pair of wool slacks over my pajamas a red sweater and a black skirt white understockings and tattered kneesocks mrs van d sat back down on the chair and mr van d lay down wi th his head on my feet from three thirty onward i was engrossed in thought and still shiver ing so much that mr van daan couldnt sleep i was preparing myse lf for the return of the police wed tell them we were in hiding if they were good people wed be safe and if they were nazi sympathizers we could try to bribe them we should hide the radio moaned mrs van d sure in the stove answered mr van d if they find us the y might as well find the radio then theyll also find annes diary added father so burn it suggested the most terrified of the group this and the police rattling on the bookcase were the moments when i was most afraid oh not my diary if my diary goes i go too thank good ness father didnt say anything more theres no point in recounting all the conversations so muc h was said i comforted mrs van daan who was very frightened we talked about escap ing being interrogated by the gestapo phoning mr kleiman and being courageous we must behave like soldiers mrs van daan if our time has c ome well then itll be for queen and country for freedom truth and justice as the yre always telling us on the radio the only bad thing is that well drag the others dow n with us after an hour mr van daan switched places with his wife again and father came and sat beside me the men smoked one cigarette after another an occasional sigh was heard somebody made another trip to the potty and then ever ything began allover again four oclock five fivethirty i went and sat with peter by his window and listened so close we could feel each others bodies trembling we spok e a word or two from time to time and listened intently next door they took down t he blackout screen they made a list of everything they were planning to tell mr k leiman over the phone because they intended to call him at seven and ask him to send s omeone over they were taking a big chance since the police guard at the door or in the warehouse might hear them calling but there was an even greater risk th at the police would return im enclosing their list but for the sake of clarity ill co py it here buralary police in building up to bookcase but no farther burglars apparently interrupted forced warehouse door fled through garden m ain entrance bolted kugler must have left through second door typewriter and adding machine safe in black chest in private office mieps or beps laundry in washtub in kitchen only bep or kugler have key to second door lock may be broken try to warn jan and get key look around office also feed cat for the rest everything went according to plan mr kleiman was phoned the poles were removed from the doors the typewriter was put back in th e chest then we all sat around the table again and waited for either jan or the pol ice peter had dropped off to sleep and mr van daan anne frank and i were lying on the floor when we heard loud footsteps below i got up quietly its jan no no its the police they all said there was a knocking at our bookcase miep whis tled this wa s too much for mrs van daan who sank limply in her chair white as a sheet if the tension had lasted another minute she would have fainted jan and miep came in and were met with a delightful scene the t able alone would have been worth a photograph a copy of cinema theater op ened to a page of dancing girls and smeared with jam and pectin which wed bee n taking to combat the diarrhea two jam jars half a bread roll a quarter of a bread roll pectin a mirror a comb matches ashes cigarettes tobacco an ashtray boo ks a pair of underpants a flashlight mrs van daans comb toilet paper etc jan and miep were of course greeted with shouts and tears jan nailed a pinewood board over the gap in the door and went off again with miep to in form the police of the breakin miep had also found a note under the ware house door from sleegers the night watchman who had noticed the hole and alerted the p olice jan was also planning to see sleegers so we had half an hour in which to put the house and ourselves to rights ive never seen such a transformation as in those thirty minutes margo t and i got the beds ready downstairs went to the bathroom brushed our teeth w ashed our hands and combed our hair then i straightened up the room a bit and went back upstairs the table had already been cleared so we got some water made cof fee and tea boiled the milk and set the table father and peter emptied our improvis ed potties and rinsed them with warm water and powdered bleach the largest one was filled to the brim and was so heavy they had a hard time lifting it to make things worse it was leaking so they had to put it in a bucket at eleven oclock jan was back and joined us at the table and g radually everyone began to relax jan had the following story to tell mr sleegers was asleep but his wife told jan that her husban d had discovered the hole in the door while making his rounds he called in a police man and the two of them searched the building mr sleegers in his capacity as night watchman patrols the area every night on his bike accompanied by his two dogs his wife said he would come on tuesday and tell mr kugler the rest no one at the poli ce station seemed to know anything about the breakin but they made a note to come first thing tuesday morning to have a look on the way back jan happened to run into mr van hoeven the man who supplies us with potatoes and told him of the breakin i know mr van hoeven calmly replied last night when my wife and i were walking past your building i saw a gap in the door my wife wanted to walk on but i peeked inside with a flas hlight and thats when the burglars must have run off to be on the safe side i di dnt call the police i thought it wouldnt be wise in your case i dont know anythin g but i have my suspicions jan thanked him and went on mr van hoeven obvi ously suspects were here because he always delivers the potatoes at lunchtime a decent man it was one oclock by the time jan left and wed done the dishes all eight of us went to bed i woke up at quarter to three and saw that mr dussel was already up my face rumpled with sleep i happened to run into peter in the ba throom just after hed come downstairs we agreed to meet in the office i freshened up a bit and went down after all this do you still dare go to the front attic he as ked i nodded grabbed my pillow with a cloth wrapped around it and we went up toget her the weather was gorgeous and even though the airraid sirens soon began to w ail we stayed where we were peter put his arm around my shoulder i put mine aroun d his and we sat quietly like this until four oclock when margot came to get us for coffee we ate our bread drank our lemonade and joked we were finall y able to again and for the rest everything was back to normal that evening i tha nked peter because hed been the bravest of us all none of us have ever been in such danger as we were that night g od was truly watching over us just thinkthe police were right at the boo kcase the light was on and still no one had discovered our hiding place now were d one for id whispered at that moment but once again we were spared when the invasi on comes and the bombs start falling itll be every man for himself but this time we feared for those good innocent christians who are helping us weve been saved keep on saving us thats all we can say this incident has brought about a whole lot of changes as of n ow dussel will be doing his work in the bathroom and peter will be patrolling t he house between eightthirty and ninethirty peter isnt allowed to open h is window anymore since one of the keg people noticed it was open we can no longer flus h the toilet after ninethirty at night mr sleegers has been hired as night wa tchman and tonight a carpenter from the underground is coming to make a barricade out of our white frankfurt bedsteads debates are going on left and right in t he annex mr kugler has reproached us for our carelessness jan also said we should n ever go downstairs what we have to do now is find out whether sleegers can be trusted w hether the dogs will bark if they hear someone behind the door how to make the barr icade all sorts of things weve been strongly reminded of the fact that were jews in ch ains chained to one spot without any rights but with a thousand obligations w e must put our feelings aside we must be brave and strong bear discomfort with out complaint do whatever is in our power and trust in god one day this terrible war will be over the time will come when well be people again and not just jews who has inflicted this on us who has set us apart from all the r est who has put us through such suffering its god who has made us the way we are but its also god who will lift us up again in the eyes of the world were doome d but if after all this suffering there are still jews left the jewish people will be held up as an example who knows maybe our religion will teach the world and all the people in it about goodness and thats the reason the only reason we have to s uffer we can never be just dutch or just english or whatever we will always be je ws as well and well have to keep on being jews but then well want to be be brave lets remember our duty and perform it without comp laint there will be a way out god has never deserted our people through the ages j ews have had to suffer but through the ages theyve gone on living and the c enturies of suffering have only made them stronger the weak shall fall and the strong sh all survive and not be defeated that night i really thought i was going to die i waited for the police and i was ready for death like a soldier on a battlefield id gladly have gi ven my life for my country but now now that ive been spared my first wish after the war is to become a dutch citizen i love the dutch i love this country i love the lang uage and i want to work

mr van d is growing pale without his cigarettes dussel whos having to give up many of his comfo rts is carping at everyone etc etc we seem to have run out of luck lately th e toilets leaking and the faucets stuck thanks to our many connections well so on be able to get these repaired im occasionally sentimental as you know but from time to t ime i have reason to be when peter and i are sitting close together on a hard wooden cr ate among the junk and dust our arms around each others shoulders peter toyi ng with a lock of my hair when the birds outside are trilling their songs when the tre es are in bud when the sun beckons and the sky is so blueoh thats when i wish for s o much all i see around me are dissatisfied and grumpy faces all i he ar are sighs and stifled complaints youd think our lives had taken a sudden turn for the worse honestly things are only as bad as you make them here in the annex no one even bothers to set a good example we each have to figure out how to get the bet ter of our own moods every day you hear if only it were all over work love courage and hope make me good and help me cope i really believe kit that im a little nutty today and i don t know why my writings all mixed up im jump ing from one thing to another and some times i seriously doubt whether anyone will ever be interested in this drivel theyll probably call it the musings of an ugly duckling my diaries certainly won t be of much use to mr bolkestein or mr gerbrandy gerrit bolkestein was the m inister of education and pieter gerbrandy was the prime minister of the dutch governm ent in exile in london see annes letter of march 29 1944 yours anne m frank saturday april 15 1944 dearest kitty theres just one bad thing after another when will it all en d you can sure say that again guess whats happened now peter forgot to unbolt the front door as a result mr kugler and the warehouse employees couldnt get in he we nt to kegs smashed in our office kitchen window and got in that way the windows i n the annex were open and the keg people saw that too what must they be thinki ng and van maaren mr kuglers furious we accuse him of not doing anything to r einforce the doors and then we do a stupid thing like this peters extremely upset at the table mother said she felt more sorry for peter than for anyone else and he near ly began to cry were equally to blame since we usually ask him every day if hes un bolted the door and so does mr van daan maybe i can go comfort him later on i want to help him so much here are the latest news bulletins about life in the secret an nex over the last few weeks a week ago saturday boche suddenly got sick he sat quite sti ll and started drooling miep immediately picked him up rolled him in a towel tucked him in her shopping bag and brought him to the dogandcat clinic boche had some kin d of intestinal problem so the vet gave him medicine peter gave it to him a few times b ut boche soon made himself scarce ill bet he was out courting his sweetheart but now his nose is swollen and he meows whenever you pick him uphe was probably trying to steal food and somebody smacked him mouschi lost her voice for a fe w days just when we decided she had to be taken to the vet too she started getti ng better we now leave the attic window open a crack every night peter a nd i often sit up there in the evening thanks to rubber cement and oil paint our toilet could quic kly be repaired the broken faucet has been replaced luckily mr kleiman is feeling better hes going to see a sp ecialist soon we can only hope he wont need an operation this month we received eight tation books unfortunately f or the next two weeks beans have been substituted for oatmeal or groats our lates t delicacy is piccalilli if youre out of luck all you get is a jar full of cucumber and mus tard sauce vegetables are hard to come by theres only lettuce lettuc e and more lettuce our meals consist entirely of potatoes and imitation gravy the russians are in possession of more than half the crimea t he british arent advancing beyond cassino well have to count on the western wall there have been a lot of unbelievably heavy air raids the registry of births deaths and marriages in the hague was bombed all dutch people will be issued new rati on registration cards enough for today yours anne m frank sunday april 16 1944 my dearest kitty remember yesterdays date since it was a redletter day for me isnt it an important day for every girl when she gets her first kiss well then it s no less important to me the time bram kissed me on my right cheek or mr woudstra on my right hand doesnt count how did i suddenly come by this kiss ill tell you last night at eight i was sitting with peter on his divan and it wasnt long before he put an arm around me since it was saturday he wasnt wearin g his overallswhy don t we move over a little i said so won t keep bumping my he ad against the cupboard he moved so far over he was practically in the corner i slippe d my arm under his and across his back and he put his arm around my shoulder so t hat i was nearly engulfed by him weve sat like this on other occasions but n ever so close as we were last night he held me firmly against him my left side ag ainst his chest my heart had already begun to beat faster but there was more to c ome he wasnt satisfied until my head lay on his shoulder with his on top of mine i sat up again after about five minutes but before long he took my head in hi s hands and put it back next to his oh it was so wonderful i could hardly talk my pl easure was too intense he caressed my cheek and arm a bit clumsily and played with m y hair most of the time our heads were touching i cant tell you kitty the feeling that ran through me i was too happy for words and i think he was too at ninethirty we stood up peter put on his tennis shoes so he wouldnt make much noise on his nightly round of the building and i was standing next to him how i suddenly made the right movement i dont know but before we went downstairs he gave me a kiss through my hair half on my left cheek and half on my ear i tore downstairs without looking back and i long so much for today sunday morning just before eleven yours anne m frank monday april 17 1944 dearest kitty do you think father and mother would approve of a girl my age si tting on a divan and kissing a seventeenand ahalfyearold boy i doubt they would but i have to trust my own judgment in this matter its so peaceful and saf e lying in his arms and dreaming its so thrilling to feel his cheek against mine i ts so wonderful to know theres someone waiting for me but and there is a but will p eter want to leave it at that i havent forgotten his promise but he is a boy i know im starting at a very young age not even fifteen and al ready so independent thats a little hard for other people to understand im pr etty sure margot would never kiss a boy unless there was some talk of an engagement or marriage neither peter nor i has any such plans im also sure that mother never touched a man before she met father what would my girlfriends or jacque say if the y knew id lain in peters arms with my heart against his chest my head on his sh oulder and his head and face against mine oh anne how terribly shocking but seriously i dont thin k its at all shocking were cooped up here cut off from the world anxious and fearful e specially lately why should we stay apart when we love each other why shouldnt we kiss each other in times like these why should we wait until weve reached a sui table age why should we ask anybodys permission ive decided to look out for my own interests hed never want to hurt me or make me unhappy why shouldnt i do what my heart tells me and makes both of us happy yet i have a feeling kitty that you can sense my doubt it mus t be my honesty rising in revolt against all this sneaking around do you thi nk its my duty to tell father what im up to do you think our secret should be shared with a third person much of the beauty would be lost but would it make me feel bett er inside ill bring it up with him oh yes i still have so much i want to discuss with him since i dont see the point of just cuddling sharing our thoughts with each other requi res a great deal of trust but well both be stronger because of it yours anne m frank ps we were up at six yesterday morning because the whole fa mily heard the sounds of a breakin again it must have been one of our neighbors who was the victim this time when we checked at seven oclock our doors were still s hut tight thank goodness tuesday april 181944 dearest kitty everythings fine here last night the carpenter came again to put some sheets of iron over the door panels father just got through saying he defin itely expects largescale operations in russia and italy as well as in the west before may 20 the longer the war lasts the harder it is to imagine being liberated from th is place yesterday peter and i finally got around to having the talk we ve been postponing for the last ten days i told him all about girls without hesitat ing to discuss the most intimate matters i found it rather amusing that he thought t he opening in a womans body was simply left out of illustrations he couldnt imagi ne that it was actually located between a womans legs the evening ended with a mutu al kiss near the mouth its really a lovely feeling i might take my favorite quotes notebook up with me sometim e so peter and i can go more deeply into matters i dont think lying in each other s arms day in and day out is very satisfying and i hope he feels the same after our mild winter weve been having a beautiful spring a pril is glorious not too hot and not too cold with occasional light showers our ches tnut tree is in leaf and here and there you can already see a few small blossoms bep presented us saturday with four bouquets of flowers thr ee bouquets of daffodils and one bouquet of grape hyacinths for me mr kugler is suppl ying us with more and more newspapers its time to do my algebra kitty bye yours anne m frank wednesday april 19 1944 dearest darling thats the title of a movie with dorit kreysler ida wust and harald paulsen what could be nicer than sitting before an open window enjoy ing nature listening to the birds sing feeling the sun on your cheeks and holding a da rling boy in your arms i feel so peaceful and safe with his arm around me knowing he s near and yet not having to speak how can this be bad when it does me so much good oh if only we were never disturbed again not even by mouschi yours anne m frank friday april 211944 my dearest kitty i stayed in bed yesterday with a sore throat but since i was al ready bored the very first afternoon and didnt have a fever i got up today my sor e throat has nearly verschwunden disappeared yesterday as youve probably already discovered was our f iihrers fiftyfifth birthday today is the eighteenth birthday of her royal high ness princess elizabeth of york the bbc reported that she hasnt yet been declared of ag e though royal children usually are weve been wondering which prince the yll marry this beauty off to but cant think of a suitable candidate perhaps her sist er princess margaret rose can have crown prince baudouin of belgium here weve been going from one disaster to the next no sooner have the outside doors been reinforced than van maaren rears his head again i n all likelihood hes the one who stole the potato flour and now hes trying to pin the b lame on bep not surprisingly the annex is once again in an uproar bep is bes ide herself with rage perhaps mr kugler will finally have this shady character ta iled the appraiser from beethovenstraat was here this morning h e offered us 400 guilders for our chest in our opinion the other estimates are also to o low i want to ask the magazine the prince if theyll take one of my f airy tales under a pseudonym of course but up to now all my fairy tales have bee n too long so i dont think i have much of a chance until the next time darling yours anne m frank tuesday april 25 1944 dearest kitty for the last ten days dussel hasnt been on speaking terms wit h mr van daan and all because of the new security measures since the breakin one of these was that hes no longer allowed to go downstairs in the evenings peter and mr van daan make the last round every night at ninethirty and after that no one m ay go downstairs we cant flush the toilet anymore after eight at night or after e ight in the morning the windows may be opened only in the morning when the lights go on in mr kuglers office and they can no longer be propped open with a stick at n ight this last measure is the reason for dussels sulking he claims that mr van daan bawled him out but he has only himself to blame he says hed rather live without food than without air and that they simply must figure out a way to keep the windows open ill have to speak to mr kugler about this he said to me i replied that we never discussed matters of this sort with mr kugler only within the group everythings always happening behind my back ill have to talk to your father about that hes also not allowed to sit in mr kuglers office anymore on saturday afternoons or sundays because the manager of kegs might hear him if he hap pens to be next door dussel promptly went and sat there anyway mr van daan was fu rious and father went downstairs to talk to dussel who came up with some flims y excuse but even father didnt fall for it this time now fathers keep ing hi s dealings with dussel to a minimum because dussel insulted him not one of us knows wha t he said but it must have been pretty awful and to think that that miserable man has his birthday next wee k how can you celebrate your birthday when youve got the sulks how can yo u accept gifts from people you wont even talk to mr voskuijl is going downhill rapidly for more than ten day s hes had a temperature of almost a hundred and four the doctor said his condition is hopeless they think the cancer has spread to his lungs the poor man wed so like to he lp him but only god can help him now ive written an amusing story called blurry the explorer which was a big hit with my three listeners i still have a bad cold and have passed it on to margot as well a s mother and father if only peter doesnt get it he insisted on a kiss and called me his el dorado you cant call a person that silly boy but hes sweet anyway yours anne m frank thursday april 27 1944 dearest kitty mrs van d was in a bad mood this morning all she did was compl ain first about her cold not being able to get cough drops and the agony of having to blow her nose all the time next she grumbled that the sun wasnt shining the i nvasion hadnt started we werent allowed to look out the windows etc etc we coul dnt help but laugh at her and it couldnt have been that bad since she soon joined in our recipe for potato kugel modified due to lack of onions put peeled potatoes through a food mill and add a little dry go vernmentissue flour and salt grease a mold or ovenproof dish with paraffin or ste arin and bake for 212 hours serve with rotten strawberry compote onions not av ailable nor oil for mold or dough at the moment im reading emperor charles v written by a prof essor at the university of gottingen hes spent forty years working on t his book it took me five days to read fifty pages i cant do any more than that since t he book has 598 pages you can figure out just how long its going to take me and that s not even counting the second volume but very interesting the things a schoolgirl has to do in the course of a single day take me for example first i translated a passage on nelsons last batt le from dutch into english then i read more about the northern war 170021 involving peter the great charles xii augustus the strong stanislaus leczinsky ma zeppa von gorz bran denburg western pomerania eastern pomerania and denmark plus the usual dates next i wound up in brazil where i read about bahia tobacco t he abundance of coffee the one and a half million inhabitants of rio de janeiro pern ambuco and sao paulo and last but not least the amazon river then about negroes mulattoes mestizos whites the illiteracy rate over 50 percent and malaria since i had some time left i glanced through a genealogical chart john the old w illiam louis ernest casimir i henry casimir i right up to little margriet franc iska born in 1943 in ottawa twelve oclock i resumed my studies in the attic reading ab out deans priests ministers popes and whew it was one oclock at two the poor child ho hum was back at work old world and ne w world monkeys were next kitty tell me quickly how many toes does a hippopotamus have then came the bible noahs ark shem ham and japheth after that charles v then with peter thack erays book about the colonel in en glish a french test and then a comparison between the mississippi and the missou ri enough for today adieu yours anne m frank friday april 28 1944 dearest kitty ive never forgotten my dream of peter schiff see the beginn ing of january even now i can still feel his cheek against mine and that wonderfu l glow that made up for all the rest once in a while id had the same feeling with this peter but never so intensely until last night we were sitting on the divan as usual in each others arms suddenly the everyday anne slipped away and the second anne took her place the second anne whos never overconfident or amusing but w ants only to love and be gentle i sat pressed against him and felt a wave of emotion come over m e tears rushed to my eyes those from the left fell on his overalls while those from the right trickled down my nose and into the air and landed beside the first did h e notice he made no movement to show that he had did he feel the same way i did he h ardly said a word did he realize he had two annes at his side my questions went unanswered at eightthirty i stood up and went to the window where we alw ays say goodbye i was still trembling i was still anne number two he came over to me and i threw my arms around his neck and kissed him on his left cheek i was a bout to kiss the other cheek when my mouth met his and we pressed our lips toge ther in a daze we embraced over and over again never to stop oh peter needs tenderness for the first time in his life hes di scovered a girl for the first time hes seen that even the biggest pests also have an i nner self and a heart and are transformed as soon as theyre alone with you for the first time in his life hes given himself and his friendship to another person he s never had a friend before boy or girl now weve found each other i for that ma tter didnt know him either had never had someone i could confide in and its led to this the same question keeps nagging me is it right is it right for me to yield so soon for me to be so passionate to be filled with as much passion an d desire as peter can i a girl allow myself to go that far theres only one possible answer im longing so much an d have for such a long time im so lonely and now ive found comfort in the mornings we act normally in the afternoons too excep t now and then but in the evenings the suppressed longing of the entire day the ha ppiness and the bliss of all the times before come rushing to the surface and all we ca n think about is each other every night after our last kiss i feel like running a way and never looking him in the eyes again away far away into the darkness and alone and what awaits me at the bottom of those fourteen stairs bri ght lights questions and laughter i have to act normally and hope they dont notic e anything my heart is still too tender to be able to recover so quickly fr om a shock like the one i had last night the gentle anne makes infrequent appearanc es and shes not about to let herself be shoved out the door so soon after shes arriv ed peters reached a part of me that no one has ever reached before except in my dre am hes taken hold of me and turned me inside out doesnt everyone need a little quiet time to put themselves to rights again oh peter what have you done to m e what do you want from me where will this lead oh now i understand bep now now that i m going through it myself i understand her doubts if i were older and he wanted to marry me what would my answer be anne be honest you wouldnt be able to ma rry him but its so hard to let go peter still has too little character too litt le willpower too little courage and strength hes still a child emotionally no old er than i am all he wants is happiness and peace of mind am i really only fourteen am i re ally just a silly schoolgirl am i really so inexperienced in everything i ha ve more experience than most ive experienced something almost no one my age ever ha s im afraid of myself afraid my longing is making me yield too soon how can it ever go right with other boys later on oh its so hard the eterna l struggle between heart and mind theres a time and a place for both but how can i be su re that ive chosen the right time yours anne m frank tuesday may 2 1944 dearest kitty saturday night i asked peter whether he thinks i should tell f ather about us after wed discussed it he said he thought i should i was glad it s hows hes sensible and sensitive as soon as i came downstairs i went with father to get some water while we were on the stairs i said father im sure youve gather ed that when peter and i are together we dont exactly sit at opposite ends of the roo m do you think thats wrong father paused before answering no i dont think its wron g but anne when youre living so close together as we do you have to be careful he said some other words to that effect and then we went upstairs sunday morning he called me to him and said anne ive been t hinking about what you said oh oh i knew what was coming here in the annex its not such a good idea i thought you were just friends is peter in love wi th you of course not i answered well you know i understand both of you but you must be the on e to show restraint dont go upstairs so often dont encourage him more than you can help in matters like these its always the man who takes the active role and its up to the woman to set the limits outside where youre free things are quite different you see other boys and girls you can go outdoors take part in sports and al l kinds of activities but here if youre together too much and want to get away you can t you see each other every hour of the dayall the time in fact be careful anne and dont take it too seriously i dont father but peters a decent boy a nice boy yes but he doesnt have much strength of character he can e asily be influenced to do good but also to do bad i hope for his sake that he stays goo d because hes basically a good person we talked some more and agreed that father would speak to him t oo sunday afternoon when we were in the front attic peter asked have you talked to your father yet anne yes i replied ill tell you all about it he doesnt thin k its wrong but he says that here where were in such close quarters it could lead to con flicts weve already agreed not to quarrel and i plan to keep my pro mise me too peter but father didnt think we were serious he th ought we were just friends do you think we still can be yes i do how about you me too i also told father that i trust you i do trust you pet er just as much as i do father and i think youre worthy of my trust you are aren t you i hope so he was very shy and blushing i believe in you peter i continued i believe you have a g ood character and that youll get ahead in this world after that we talked about other things later i said if we e ver get out of here i know you wont give me another thought he got all fired up thats not true anne oh no i wont let y ou even think that about me just then somebody called us father did talk to him he told me monday your father though t our friendship might turn into love he said but i told him wed keep ourselves u nder control father wants me to stop going upstairs so often but i dont wa nt to not just because i like being with peter but because ive said i trust him i do trust him and i want to prove it to him but ill never be able to if i stay downstair s out of distrust no im going in the meantime the dussel drama has been resolved saturda y evening at dinner he apologized in beautiful dutch mr van daan was immediately reconciled dussel must have spent all day practicing his speech sunday his birthday passed without incident we gave him a bottle of good wine from 1919 the van daans who can now give their gift after all pre sented him with a jar of piccalilli and a package of razor blades and mr kugler ga ve him a jar of lemon syrup to make lemonade miep a book little martin and bep a plant he treated everyone to an egg yours anne m frank wednesday may 3 1944 dearest kitty first the weekly news were having a vacation from politics theres nothing and i mean absolutely nothing to report im also gradually star ting to believe that the invasion will come after all they cant let the russians do all the dirty work actually the russians arent doing anything at the moment e ither mr kleiman comes to the office every morning now he got a new set of springs for peters divan so peter will have to get to work reupholsteri ng it not surprisingly he isnt at all in the mood mr kleiman also brought some flea po wder for the cats have i told you that our boche has disappeared we havent see n hide nor hair of her since last thursday shes probably already in cat heaven w hile some animal lover has turned her into a tasty dish perhaps some girl who can afford it will be wearing

me as you can no doubt imagine we often say in despair whats t he point of the war why oh why cant people live together peacefully why all t his destruction the question is understandable but up to now no one has come u p with a satisfactory answer why is england manufacturing bigger and better airp lanes and bombs and at the same time churning out new houses for reconstruction wh y are millions spent on the war each day while not a penny is available for medical sc ience artists or the poor why do people have to starve when mountains of food are r otting away in other parts of the world oh why are people so crazy i dont believe the war is simply the work of politicians and c apitalists oh no the common man is every bit as guilty otherwise people and nati ons would have re belled long ago theres a destructive urge in people the ur ge to rage murder and kill and until all of humanity without exception undergo es a metamorphosis wars will continue to be waged and everything that has been caref ully built up cultivated and grown will be cut down and destroyed only to start allove r again ive often been down in the dumps but never desperate i look upon our life in hiding as an interesting adventure full of danger and romance and every privation as an amusing addition to my diary ive made up my mind to lead a dif ferent life from other girls and not to become an ordinary housewife later on what im experiencing here is a good beginning to an interesting life and thats the reaso n the only reason why i have to laugh at the humorous side of the most dangerous m oments im young and have many hidden qualities im young and stron g and living through a big adventure im right in the middle of it and cant spend al l day complaining because its impossible to have any fun im blessed with many things happiness a cheerful disposition and strength every day i feel myself maturing i feel liberation drawing near i feel the beauty of nature and the goodness of the peopl e around me every day i think what a fascinating and amusing adventure this is with all that why should i despair yours anne m frank friday may 5 1944 dear kitty fathers unhappy with me after our talk on sunday he thought id stop going upstairs every evening he wont have any of that knutscherej ne cking going on i cant stand that word talking about it was bad enough why does he have to make me feel bad too ill have a word with him today margot gave me so me good advice heres more or less what id like to say i think you expect an explanation from me father so ill giv e you one youre disap pointed in me you expected more restraint from me you no dou bt want me to act the way a fourteenyearold is supposed to but thats where you re wrong since weve been here from july 1942 until a few weeks ago i

i dont need the support of mother or a nyone else it didnt happen overnight ive struggled long and hard and shed many tears to become as independent as i am now you can laugh and refuse to believe me but i dont care i know im an independent person and i dont feel i need to acco unt to you for my actions im only telling you this because i dont want you to think im doing things behind your back but theres only one person im accountabl e to and thats me when i was having problems everyone and that includes you closed their eyes and ears and didnt help me on the contrary all i ever go t were admonitions not to be so noisy i was noisy only to keep myself from being miser able all the time i was overconfident to keep from having to listen to the voice i nside me ive been putting on an act for the last year and a half day in day out i ve never complained or dropped my mask nothing of the kind and now now the bat tle is over ive won im independent in both body and mind i dont need a mot her anymore and ive emerged from the struggle a stronger person now that its over now that i know the battle has been won i wa nt to go my own way to follow the path that seems right to me dont think of m e as a fourteenyearold since all these troubles have made me ol der i wont regret my actions ill behave the way i think i should gentle persuasion wont keep me from going upstairs youll either have to forbid it or trust me through thick and thin whatever you do just leave m e alone yours anne m frank saturday may 6 1944 dearest kitty last night before dinner i tucked the letter id written into fathers pocket according to margot he read it and was upset for the rest of the evening i was upstairs doing the dishes poor pim i might have known what the effect of su ch an epistle would be hes so sensitive i immediately told peter not to ask any questions or say anything more pims said nothing else to me about the matter is he going to everything here is more or less back to normal we can hardly b elieve what jan mr kugler and mr kleiman tell us about the prices and the people on the outside half a pound of tea costs 35000 guilders half a pound of coffee 80 00 guilders a pound of butter 3500 guilders one egg 145 guilders people are pay ing 1400 guilders an ounce for bulgarian tobacco everyones trading on the blac k market every errand boy has something to offer the delivery

occurrences even the police and night watchmen are getting in on the act every one wants to put food in their stomachs and since salaries have been frozen peop le have had to resort to swindling the police have their hands full trying to track d own the many girls of fifteen sixteen seventeen and older who are reported miss ing every day i want to try to finish my story about ellen the fairy just fo r fun i can give it to father on his birthday together with all the copyrights see you later actually thats not the right phrase in the german program broadcast from england they always close with aufwiederhoren so i g uess i should say until we write again yours anne m frank sunday morning may 71944 dearest kitty father and i had a long talk yesterday afternoon i cried my ey es out and he cried too do you know what he said to me kitty ive received many letters in my lifetime but none as hurtf ul as this you who have had so much love from your parents you whose parents have al ways been ready to help you who have always defended you no matter what you ta lk of not having to account to us for your actions you feel youve been wronged a nd left to your own devices no anne youve done us a great injustice perhaps you didnt mean it that way but thats what you wrot e no anne we have done nothing to deserve such a reproach oh ive failed miserably this is the worst thing ive ever d one in my entire life i used my tears to show off to make myself seem important so he d respect me ive certainly had my share of unhappiness and everything i said about mother is true but to accuse pim whos so good and whos done everything for me no that was too cruel for words its good that somebody has finally cut me down to size has br oken my pride because ive been far too smug not everything mistress anne does is good any one who deliberately causes such pain to someone they say the y love is despicable the lowest of the low what im most ashamed of is the way father has forgiven me he s aid hes going to throw the letter in the stove and hes being so nice to me now as if he were the one whod done something wrong well anne you still have a l ot to learn its time you made a beginning in stead of looking down at others and a lways giving them the blame ive known a lot of sorrow but who hasnt at my age ive been p utting on an act but was hardly even aware of it ive felt lonely but never despe rate not like father who once ran out into the street with a knife so he could put an e nd to it all ive never gone that far i should be deeply ashamed of myself and i am whats done can t be undone but at least you can keep it from happening again id like to start a ll over and that shouldnt be difficult now that i have peter with him supporting me i know i can do it im not alone anymore he loves me i love him i have my books my w riting and my diary im not all that ugly or that stupid i have a sunny dis position and i want to develop a good character yes anne you knew full well that your letter was unkind and u ntrue but you were actually proud of it ill take father as my example once agai n and i will improve myself yours anne m frank monday may 8 1944 dearest kitty have i ever told you anything about our family i dont think i have so let me begin father was born in frankfurt am main to very wealthy parents michael frank owned a bank and became a millionaire and alice sterns parents we re prominent and welltodo michael frank didnt start out rich he was a sel fmade man in his youth father led the life of a rich mans son parties every we ek balls banquets beautiful girls waltzing dinners a huge house etc afte r grandpa died most of the money was lost and after the great war and inflation there wa s nothing left at all up until the war there were still quite a few rich relatives so f ather was extremely wellbred and he had to laugh yesterday because for the firs t time in his fiftyfive years he scraped out the frying pan at the table mothers family wasnt as wealthy but still fairly wellof f and weve listened openmouthed to stories of private balls dinners and engage ment parties with 250 guests were far from rich now but ive pinned all my hopes on after t he war i can assure you im not so set on a bourgeois life as mother and margot i d like to spend a year in paris and london learning the languages and studying art h istory compare that with margot who wants to nurse newborns in palestine i still hav e visions of gorgeous dresses and fascinating people as ive told you many times b efore i want to see the world and do all kinds of exciting things and a little money w ont hurt this morning miep told us about her cousins engagement part y which she went to on saturday the cousins parents are rich and the grooms are even richer miep made our mouths water telling us about the food that was served ve getable soup with meatballs cheese rolls with sliced meat hors doeuvres m ade with eggs and roast beef rolls with cheese genoise wine and cigarettes and y ou could eat as much as you wanted miep drank ten schnapps and smoked three cigarettes could this be our temperance advocate if miep drank all those i wonder how ma ny her spouse managed to toss down everyone at the party was a little tipsy of course there were also two officers from the homicide squad who took phot ographs of the wedding couple you can see were never far from mieps thoughts sin ce she promptly noted their names and addresses in case anything should happen and we needed contacts with good dutch people our mouths were watering so much we whod had nothing but tw o spoonfuls of hot cereal for breakfast and were absolutely famished we who g et nothing but halfcooked spinach for the vitamins and rotten pota to es day after day we who fill our empty stomachs with nothing but boiled lettuce raw lettuce spinach spinach and more spinach maybe well end up being as strong as popeye though up to now ive seen no sign of it if miep had taken us along to the party there wouldnt have be en any rolls left over for the other guests if wed been there wed have snatched u p everything in sight including the furniture i tell you we were practically pul ling the words right out of her mouth we were gathered around her as if wed never in all o ur lives heard of delicious food or elegant people and these are the granddau ghters of the distinguished millionaire the world is a crazy place yours anne m frank tuesday may 9 1944 dearest kitty ive finished my story about ellen the fairy ive copied it out on nice notepaper decorated it with red ink and

coffee might do the trick no mr kleiman answered please dont or well never get her off the can a roar of laughter the can mrs van d asked what does th at mean an explanation was given is it all right to use that word she asked in perfect innocence just imagine bep giggled there you are shop ping at the bijenkorf and you ask the way to the can they wouldnt even know what you wer e talking about

of water behind me i asked peter what it m ight be without pausing to reply he dashed up to the loftthe scene of the dis aster and shoved mouschi who was squatting beside her soggy litter box back to the right place this was followed by shouts and squeals and then mouschi who by t hat time had finished peeing took off downstairs in search of something similar to her box mouschi had found herself a pile of wood shavings right over a crack in th e floor the puddle immediately trickled down to the attic and as luck would hav e it landed in and next to the potato barrel the cethng was dripping and since the a ttic floor has also got its share of cracks little yellow drops were leaking through th e ceiling and onto the dining table between a pile of stockings and books i was doubled up with laughter it was such a funny sight ther e was mouschi crouched under a chair peter armed with water powdered ble ach and a cloth and mr van daan trying to calm everyone down the room was soon set to rights but its a wellknown fact that cat puddles stink to high heaven the po tatoes proved that all too well as did the wood shavings which father collected in a bucket and brought downstairs to burn poor mouschi how were you to know its impossible to get peat for your box anne thursday may 11 1944 dearest kitty a new sketch to make you laugh peters hair had to be cut and as usual his mother was

attic stairs where he was obliged to le t go of her mrs van d came back to the room and collapsed into a chair with a loud sig h die enifuhruna der mutter i joked the abduction of m other a possible reference to mozarts opera the abduction from the seraglio yes but he hurt me i went to have a look and cooled her hot red wrists with water peter still by the stairs and growing impa tient again

slammed the door to my inner self if he ever wants to force the lock again hell h ave to use a harder crowbar yours anne m frank saturday may 20 1944 dearest kitty last night when i came down from the attic i noticed the mome nt i entered the room that the lovely vase of carnations had fallen over mot her was down on her hands and knees mopping up the water and margot was fishing my papers off the floor what happened i asked with anxious foreboding an d before they could reply i assessed the damage from across the room my entire genealo gy file my notebooks my books everything was afloat i nearly cried and i was so u pset i started speaking german i cant remember a word but according to margot i bab bled something about unlioersehbarer schaden schrecklich entsetzlich nie zu ersetzen incalculable loss terrible awful irreplaceable and much more fadi er burst out laughing and modier and margot joined in but i felt like crying because al l my work and elaborate notes were lost i took a closer look and luckily die incalculable loss wa snt as bad as id expected up in die attic i carefully peeled apart die sheets of paper di at were stuck togedier and dien hung diem on die clodiesline to dry it was such a funn y sight even i had to laugh maria de medici alongside charles v william of oran ge and marie antoinette its rassenschande mr van daan joked an affront to ra cial purity after entrusting my papers to peters care i went back downs tairs which books are ruined i asked margot who was going dirou gh them algebra margot said but as luck would have it my algebra book wasnt entirely rui ned i wish it had fallen right in the vase ive never loathed any book as much as that o ne inside the front cover are the names of at least twenty girls who had it before i did its old yellowed full of scribbles crossedout words and revisio ns the next time im in a wicked mood im going to tear the darned thing to pieces yours anne m frank monday may 221944 dearest kitty on may 20 father lost his bet and had to give five jars of yogur t to mrs van daan the invasion still hasnt begun i can safely say that all of a msterdam all of holland in fact the entire western coast of europe all the way down to spain are talking about the invasion day and night debating making bets and hoping the suspense is rising to fever pitch by no means has everyon e we think of as good dutch people kept their faith in the english not ever yone thinks the english bluff is a masterful strategical move oh no people want dee dsgreat heroic deeds no one can see farther than the end of their nose no one gives a thought to the fact that the british are fighting for their own country and their own people everyone thinks its englands duty to save holland as quickly as pos sible what obligations do the english have toward us what have the dutch done to deserv e the generous help they so clearly expect oh no the dutch are very much mistake n the english despite their bluff are certainly no more to blame for the wa r than all the other countries large and small that are now occupied by the germ ans the british are not about to offer their excuses true they were sleeping durin g the years germany was rearming itself but all the other countries especially th ose bordering on germany were asleep too england and the rest of the world have discov ered that burying your head in the sand doesnt work and now each of them especiall y england is having to pay a heavy price for its ostrich policy no country sacrifices its men without reason and certainly not in the interests of another and england is no exception the invasion liberat ion and freedom will come someday yet england not the occupied territories will ch oose the moment to our great sorrow and dismay weve heard that many people h ave changed their attitude toward us jews weve been told that antisemitism has cropped up in circles where once it would have been unthinkable this fact has affe cted us all very very deeply the reason for the hatred is understandable maybe e ven human but that doesnt make it right according to the christians the jews are blabbing their secrets to the germans denouncing their helpers and causing them to suffer the dreadful fate and punishments that have already been meted out to so many a ll of this is true but as with everything they should look at the matter from both s ides would christians act any differently if they were in our place could anyone r egardless of whether theyre jews or christians remain silent in the face of germ an pressure everyone knows its practically impossible so why do they ask the imp ossible of the jews its being said in underground circles that the german jews w ho immigrated to holland before the war and have now been sent to poland shouldnt be al lowed to return here they were granted the right to asylum in holland but once hit ler is gone they should go back to germany when you hear that you begin to wonder why were fighting thi s long and difficult war were always being told that were fighting for freedom truth and justice the war isnt even over and already theres dissension and jews are regarded as lesser beings oh its sad very sad that the old adage has been conf irmed for the umpteenth time what one christian does is his own responsibthty wha t one jew does reflects on all jews to be honest i cant understand how the dutch a nation of goo d honest upright people can sit in judgment on us the way they do on usthe mos t oppressed unfortunate and pitiable people in all the world i have only one hope that this antisemitism is just a passin g thing that the dutch will show their true colors that theyll never waver from wh at they know in their hearts to be just for this is unjust and if they ever carry out this terrible threat the meager ha ndful of jews still left in holland will have to go we too will have to shoulder our bundl es and move on away from this beautiful country which once so kindly took us in a nd now turns its back on us i love holland once i hoped it would become a fatherland to me since i had lost my own and i hope so still yours anne m frank thursday may 25 1944 dearest kitty beps engaged the news isnt much of a surprise though none of us are particularly pleased bertus may be a nice steady athletic young man bu t bep doesnt love him and to me thats enough reason to advise her against marrying him beps trying to get ahead in the world and bertus is pulling h er back hes a laborer without any interests or any desire to make something of hims elf and i dont think thatll make bep happy i can understand beps wanting to put an end to her indecision four weeks ago she decided to write him off but t hen she felt even worse so she wrote him a letter and now shes engaged there are several factors involved in this engagement firs t beps sick father who likes bertus very much second shes the oldest of the vosku ijl girls and her mother teases her about being an old maid third shes just turned t wentyfour and that matters a great deal to bep mother said it would have been better if bep had simply had an a ffair with bertus i dont know i feel sorry for bep and can understand her loneli ness in any case they can get married only after the war since bertus is in hiding or at any rate has gone underground besides they dont have a penny to their name a nd nothing in the way of a hope chest what a sorry prospect for bep for whom we all w ish the best i only hope bertus improves under her influence or that bep fi nds another man one who knows how to appreciate her yours anne m frank the same day theres something happening every day this morning mr van hoeven was arrested he was hiding two jews in his house its a heavy blow for us no t only because those poor jews are once again balancing on the edge of an abys s but also because its terrible for mr van hoeven the worlds been turned upside down the most decent people a re being sent to concentration camps prisons and lonely cells while the lo west of the low rule over young and old rich and poor one gets caught for black market eering another for hiding jews or other un fortunate souls unless youre a naz i you dont know whats going to happen to you from one day to the next mr van hoeven is a great loss to us too bep cant possibly lug such huge amounts of potatoes all the way here nor should she have to so our only c hoice is to eat fewer of them ill tell you what we have in mind but its certainly not going to make life here any more agreeable mother says well skip breakfast e at hot cereal and bread for lunch and fried potatoes for dinner and if possible veg etables or lettuce once or twice a week thats all there is were going to be hungry bu t nothings worse than being caught yours anne m frank friday may 26 1944 my dearest kitty at long long last i can sit quietly at my table before the cra ck in the window frame and write you everything everything i want to say i feel more miserable than i have in months even after the bre akin i didnt feel so utterly broken inside and out on the one hand theres the n ews about mr van hoeven the jewish question which is discussed in detail by everyone in the house the invasion which is so long in coming the awful food the tension the misera ble atmosphere my disappointment in peter on the other han d theres beps engagement the pentecost reception the flowers mr kugl ers birthday cakes and stories about cabarets movies and concerts that gap that enormous gap is always there one day were laugh ing at the comical side of life in h iding and the next day and there are many such days were frightened and the fea r tension and despair can be read on our faces miep and mr kugler bear the greatest burden for us and for al l those in hidingmiep in everything she does and mr kugler through his enormous re sponsibthty for the eight of us which is sometimes so overwhelming that he can ha rdly speak from the pentup tension and strain mr kleiman and bep also take ver y good care of us but theyre able to put the annex out of their minds even if its o nly for a few hours or a few days they have their own worries mr kleiman with his h ealth and bep with her engagement which isnt looking very promising lat the m oment but they also have their outings their visits with friends their everyday li ves as ordinary people so that the tension is sometimes relieved if only for a short while while ours never is never has been not once in the two years weve been here how much lo nger will this increasingly oppressive unbearable weight press i down on us the drains are clogged again we cant run the wa ter or if we do only a trickle we cant flush the toilet so we have to use a toilet brush and weve been putting our dirty water into a big earthenware jar we can man age for tod ay but what will happen if the plumber cant fix it on his own the sanitation d epartment cant come until tuesday miep sent us a raisin bread with happy pentecost written on top its almost as if she were mocking us since our moods and cares are far from ha ppy weve all become more frightened since the van hoeven busine ss once again you hear shh from all i sides and were doing everything more quiet ly the police forced the door there they could just as easily do that here too what wi ll we do if were ever no i mustnt write that down but the question wont let it self be pushed to the back of my mind today on the contrary all the fear ive ever f elt is looming before me in all its horror i had to go downstairs alone at eight this evening to use the ba throom there was no one down there since they were all listening to the radio i w anted to be brave but it was hard i always feel safer upstairs than in that huge sile nt house when im alone with those mysterious muffied sounds from upstairs and the h onking of horns in the street i have to hurry and remind myself where i am to keep fro m getting the shivers miep has been acting much nicer toward us since her talk with f ather but i havent told you about that yet miep came up one afternoon all flushe d and asked father straight out if we thought they too were infected with the cur rent antisemitism father was stunned and quickly talked her out of the idea but some of mieps suspicion has lingered on theyre doing more errands for us now and showing more of an interest in our troubles though we certainly shouldn t bother them with our woes oh theyre such good noble people ive asked myself again and again whether it wouldnt have be en better if we hadnt gone into hiding if we were dead now and didnt have to go thro ugh this misery especially so that the others could be spared the burden but we all shrink from this thought we still love life we havent yet forgotten the voi ce of nature and we keep hoping hoping for everything let something happen soon even an air raid nothing can be mo re crushing than this anxiety let the end come however cruel at least then well know whether we are to be the victors or the vanquished yours anne m frank wednesday may 31 1944 dearest kitty saturday sunday monday and tuesday it was too hot to hold my fountain pen which is why i couldnt write to you friday the drains were clogged saturday they were fixed mrs kleiman came for a visit in the afternoon and told us a lot about jopiej she and jacque van

kitty if youre going to the attic take an umbrella with you pref erably a large one this is to protect you from household showers theres a dutch p roverb high and dry safe and sound but it obviously doesnt apply to wartime g uns and to people in hiding cat box mouschis gotten into the habit of reliev ing herself on some newspapers or between the cracks in the floor boards so we ha ve good reason to fear the splatters and even worse the stench the new moortje in the warehouse has the same problem anyone whos ever had a cat thats not housebro ken can imagine the smells other than pepper and thyme that permeate this hous e i also have a brandnew prescription for gunfire jitters wh en the shooting gets loud proceed to the nearest wooden staircase run up and down a few times making sure to stumble at least once what with the scratches and the nois e of running and falling you wont even be able to hear the shooting much less worry ab out it yours truly has put this magic formula to use

clos e friendship between the latter and mrs van daan flirtations kisses and friendly l ittle smiles dussel is beginning to long for female companionship the van daans dont see why we should bake a

even less interesting the bottom of our black moneybox is in sight what are we going to live on next month yours anne m frank tuesday june 6 1944 my dearest kitty this is d day the bbc announced at twelve this is the day the invasion has begun this morning at eight the british reported heavy bombing of c alais boulogne le havre and cherbourg as well as pas de calais as usual furt her as a precautionary measure for those in the occupied territories everyone liv ing within a zone of twenty miles from the coast was warned to prepare for bombardments where possible the british will drop pamphlets an hour ahead of time according to the german news british paratroopers have lan ded on the coast of france british landing craft are engaged in combat with ge rman naval units according to the bbc conclusion reached by the annex while breakfasting at nine this is a trial landing like the one two years ago in dieppe bbc broadcast in german dutch french and other languages a t ten the invasion has begun so this is the real invasion bbc broadcast in germa n at eleven speech by supreme commander general dwight eisenhower bbc broadcast in english this is 0 day general eisenhowe r said to the french people stiff fighting will come now but after this the vic tory the year 1944 is the year of complete victory good luck bbc broadcast in english at one 11000 planes are shuttling back and forth or standing by to land troops and bomb behind enemy lines 4000 landing craft and small boats are continually arriving in the area between cher bou rg and le havre english and american troops are already engaged in heavy combat spe eches by gerbrandy the prime minister of belgium king haakon of norway de gaul le of france the king of england and last but not least churchill a huge commotion in the annex is this really the beginning of the longawaited liberation the liberation weve all talked so much about w hich still seems too good too much of a fairy tale ever to come true will this year 1944 bring us victory we dont know yet but where theres hope theres life it fill s us with fresh courage and makes us strong again well need to be brave to endure the man y fears and hardships and the suffering yet to come its now a matter of remaining c alm and steadfast of gritting our teeth and keeping a stiff upper lip france rus sia italy and even germany can cry out in agony but we dont yet have that right oh kitty the best part about the invasion is that i have the f eeling that friends are on the way those terrible germans have oppressed and threat ened us for so long that the thought of friends and salvation means everything to us now its not just the jews but holland and all of occupied europe maybe margot s ays i can even go back to school in october or september yours anne m frank ps ill keep you informed of the latest news this morning and last night dummies made of straw and rubber were dropped from the air behind german lines and they exploded the minute the y hit the ground many paratroopers their faces blackened so they couldnt be see n in the dark landed as well the french coast was bombarded with 5500 tons of bombs during the night and then at six in the morning the first landing craft came asho re today there were 20000 airplanes in action the german coastal batteries we re destroyed even before the landing a small bridgehead has already been formed eve rythings going well despite the bad weather the army and the people are one will and one hope friday june 9 1944 dearest kitty great news of the invasion the allies have taken bayeux a vi llage on the coast of france and are now fighting for caen theyre clearly inten ding to cut off the peninsula where cherbourg is located every evening the war correspondents report on the difficulties the courage and the fighting spirit of the army to get their stories they pull off the most amazing feats a few of the wounded who a re already back in england also spoke on the radio despite the miserable weath er the planes are flying dthgently back and forth we heard over the bbc that churchil l wanted to land along with the troops on d day but eisenhower and the other general s managed to talk him out of it just imagine so much courage for such an old man he m ust be at least seventy the excitement here has died down somewhat still were all hoping that the war will finally be over by the end of the year its about time mrs va n daans constant griping is unbearable now that she can no longer drive us cra zy with the invasion she moans and groans all day about the bad weather if only we coul d plunk her down in the loft in a bucket of cold water everyone in the annex except mr van daan and peter has read th e hunaarian rhapsody trilogy a biography of the composer piano virtuo so and child prodigy franz liszt its very interesting though in my opinion theres a bit too much emphasis on women liszt was not only the greatest and most famous pianis t of his time he was also the biggest womanizer even at the age of seventy he had an affair with countess marie d agoult princess carolyne sayn wittgens tein the dancer lola montez the pianist agnes kingworth the pianist sophie men ter the circassian princess olga janina baroness olga meyen dorff actress l illa whatshername etc etc and theres no end to it those parts of the book de aling with music and the other arts are much more interesting some of the people ment ioned are schumann clara wieck hector berlioz johannes brahms beethoven j oachim richard wagner hans von bulow anton rubinstein frederic chopin victor h ugo honore de balzac hiller hummel czerny rossini cherubini paganini men dels sohn etc etc liszt appears to have been a decent man very generous and mod est though exceptionally vain he helped others put art above all else was extremely fond of cognac and women couldnt bear the sight of tears was a gent leman couldnt refuse anyone a favor wasnt interested in money and cared about re ligious freedom and the world yours anne m frank 314 anne frank tuesday june 13 1944 dearest kit another birthday has gone by so im now fifteen i received q uite a few gifts springers fivevolume art history book a set of underwear two belts a handkerchief two jars of yogurt a jar of jam two honey cookies small a b otany book from father and mother a gold bracelet from margot a sticker alb um from the van daans biomalt and sweet peas from dussel candy from miep candy an d notebooks from bep and the high point the book maria theresa and three slices of fullcream cheese from mr kugler peter gave me a lovely bouquet of peonies th e poor boy had put a lot of effort into finding a present but nothing quite worke d out the invasion is still going splendidly in spite of the miser able weather pouring rains gale winds and high seas yesterday churchill smuts eisenhower and arnold visited the french villages that the british have captured and liberated churchill was on a torp edo boat that shelled the coast uke many men he doesnt seem to know what fear is an e nviable trait from our position here in fort annex its difficult to gauge the mood of the dutch no doubt many people are glad the idle british have finall y rolled up their sleeves and gotten down to work those who keep claim ing they dont w ant to be occupied by the british dont realize how unfair theyre being their line of reasoning boils down to this england must fight struggle and sacri fice it s sons to liberate holland and the other occupied countries after that the british sho uldnt remain in hol land they should offer their most abject apologies to all the occu pied countries restore the dutch east indies to its rightful owner and then return weak ened and impoverished to england what a bunch of idiots and yet as ive already said many dutch people can be counted among their ranks what would have become of holla nd and its neighbors if england had signed a peace treaty with germany as its had am ple opportunity to do holland would have become german and that would have been th e end of that all those dutch people who still look down on the british sco ff at england and its government of old fogies call the english cowards yet hate the germans should be given a good shaking the way youd plump up a pillow maybe th at would straighten out their jumbled brains wishes thoughts accusations and reproaches are swirling around in my head im not really as conceited as many people think i know my various fa ults and shortcomings better than anyone else but theres one difference i also k now that i want to change will change and already have changed greatly why is it i often ask myself that everyone still thinks im s o pushy and such a knowitall am i really so arrogant am i the one whos so arr ogant or are they it sounds crazy i know but im not going to cross out that las t sentence because its not as crazy as it seems mrs van daan and dussel my two chief accusers are known to be totally unintelligent and not to put too fine a po int on it just plain stupid stupid people usually cant bear it when others do something better than they do the best examples of this are those two dummies mrs van d aan and dussel mrs van d thinks im stupid because i dont suffer so much from th is ailment as she does she thinks im pushy because shes even pushier she thinks m y dresses are too short because hers are even shorter and she thinks im such a know itall because she talks twice as much as i do about topics she knows nothing abou t the same goes for dussel but one of my favorite sayings is where theres smok e theres fire and i readily admit im a knowitall whats so difficult about my personality is that i scold and c urse myself much more than anyone else does if mother adds her advice the pile of s ermons becomes so thick that i despair of ever getting through them then i talk back and start contradicting everyone until the old famthar anne refrain i nevitably crops up again no one understands me this phrase is part of me and as unlikely as it may seem there s a kernel of truth in it sometimes im so deeply buried under selfreproaches th at i long for a word of comfort to help me dig myself out again if only i had someone w ho took my feelings seriously alas i havent yet found that person so the sear ch must go on i know youre wondering about peter arent you kit its tr ue peter loves me not as a girlfriend but as a friend his affection grows day by day but some mysterious force is holding us back and i dont know what it is sometimes i think my terrible longing for him was overexagge rated but thats not true because if im unable to go to his room for a day or two i l ong for him as desperately as i ever did peter is kind and good and yet i can t deny that hes disappointed me in many ways i especially dont care for his dislike of religion his table conversations and various things of that nature stil l im firmly convinced that well stick to our agreement never to quarrel peter is peace loving tolerant and extremely easygoing he lets me say a lot of things to him that hed never accept from his mother hes making a determined effort to remove th e blots from his copybook and keep his affairs in order yet why does he hide hi s innermost self and never allow me access of course hes much more closed than i am but i know from experience even though im constantly being accused of kno wing all there is to know in theory but not in practice that in time even the most unc ommunicative types will long as much or even more for someone to confide in peter and i have both spent our contemplative years in the ann ex we often discuss the future the past and the present but as ive already told you i miss the real thing and yet i know it exists is it because i havent been outdoors for so long that ive bec ome so smitten with nature i remember a time when a magnificent blue sky chirpi ng birds moonlight and budding blossoms wouldnt have captivated me things have c hanged since i came here one night during the pentecost holiday for instance when it was so hot i struggled to keep my eyes open until eleventhirty so i could get a good look at the moon all on my own for once alas my sacrifice was in vain si nce there was too much glare and i couldnt risk opening a window an other tim e several months ago i happened to be upstairs one night when the window was open i didnt go back down until it had to be closed again the dark rainy evening the w ind the racing clouds had me spellbound it was the first time in a year and a half tha t id seen the night facetoface after that evening my longing to see it again w as even greater than my fear of burglars a dark ratinfested house or robberies i w ent downstairs all by myself and looked out the windows in the kitchen and private o ffice many people think nature is beautiful many people sleep from time to tim e under the starry sky and many people in hospitals and prisons long for the day when theyll be free to enjoy what nature has to offer but few are as isolated and cut off as we are from dle joys of nature which can be shared by rich and poor alike its not just my imagination looking at dle sky dle clouds dle moon and dle stars really does make me feel calm and hopeful its much better me dicine than valerian or bromide nature makes me feel humble and ready to face every b low with courage as luck would have it im only able except for a few rare occ asionsto view nature through dusty curtains tacked over dirtcaked windo ws it takes dle pleasure out of looking nature is dle one thing for which dlere is no su bstitute one of dle many questions that have often bodlered me is why wo men have been and still are thought to be so inferior to men its easy to say it s unfair but thats not enough for me id really like to know the reason for this grea t injustice men presumably dominated women from the very beginning beca use of their greater physical strength its men who earn a living beget childre n and do as they please until recently women silently went along willi this which was stupid since the longer its kept up the more deeply entrenched it becomes fortuna tely education work and progress have opened womens eyes in many countries theyv e been granted equal rights many people mainly women but also men now realize how wrong it was to tolerate this state of affairs for so long modern women want the right to be completely independent but thats not all women should be respected as well genera lly speaking men are held in great esteem in all parts ofthe world so why shouldn t women have their share soldiers and war heroes are honored and commemorated explorers are granted immortal fame martyrs are revered but how many people look upon women too as soldiers in the book soldiers on the home front i was greatly struck by t he fact that in childbirth alone women commonly suffer more pain illness and misery than any war hero ever does and whats her reward for enduring all that pa in she gets pushed aside when shes disfigured by birth her children soon leav e her beauty is gone women who struggle and suffer pain to ensure the con tinuat ion of the human race make much tougher and more courageous soldiers than all thos e bigmouthed freedomfighting heroes put together i dont mean to imply that women should stop having children on the contrary nature intended them to and thats the way it should be what i conde mn are our system of values and the men who dont acknowledge how great difficul t but ultimately beautiful womens share in society is i agree completely with paul de kruif the author of this book when he says that men must learn that birth is no longer thought of as inevitable an d unavoidable in those parts of the world we consider civthzed its easy for men to t alk they dont and never will have to bear the woes that women do i believe that in the course of the next century the notion tha t its a womans duty to have children will change and make way for the respect and adm iration of all women who bear their burdens without complaint or a lot of pompous w ords yours anne m frank friday june 16 1944 dearest kitty new problems mrs van d is at her wits end shes talking ab out getting shot being thrown in prison being hanged and suicide shes jealous th at peter confides in me and not in her offended that dussel doesnt re spond sufficien tly to her flirtations and afraid her husbands going to squander all the furcoat mone y on to bacco she quarrels curses cries feels sorry for herself laughs an d starts

yours anne m frank tuesday june 27 1944 my dearest kitty the mood has changed everythings going enormously well c herbourg vitebsk and zhlobin fell today theyre sure to have captured lots of men and equipment five german generals were killed near cherbourg and two taken cap tive now that theyve got a harbor the british can bring whatever they want on shor e the whole cotentin peninsula has been captured just three weeks after the invas ion what a feat in the three weeks since d day there hasnt been a day without r ain and storms neither here nor in france but this bad luck hasnt kept the b ritish and the americans from displaying their might and how of course the germans have launched their wonder weapon but a little firecracker like that wont hard ly make a dent except maybe minor damage in england and screaming headlines in the kraut newspapers anyway when they realize in krautland that the bolshevik s really are getting closer theyll be shaking in their boots all german women who arent working for the military are bein g evacuated together with their children from the coastal regions to the provinc es of groningen friesland and gelderland mussert the leader of the dutch national socialist nazi party has announced that if the invasion reaches holland hell en list is that fat pig planning to fight he could have done that in russia long before now fi nland turned down a peace offer some time ago and now the negotiations have been broken off again those numbskulls theyll be sorry how far do you think well be on july 27 yours anne m frank friday june 30 1944 dearest kitty bad weather from one at a stretch to the thirty june annes e nglish dont i say that well oh yes i already know a little english just to pro ve it im reading an ideal husband with the help of a dictionary wars going wond erfully bobruysk mogilev and orsha have fallen lots of prisoners everythings all right here spirits are improving our sup eroptimists are triumphant the van daans are doing disappearing acts with the sugar bep s changed her hair and miep has a week off thats the latest news ive been having really ghastly rootcanal work done on one o f my front teeth its been terribly painful it was so bad dussel thought i was goin g to faint and i nearly did mrs van d promptly got a toothache as well yours anne m frank ps weve heard from basel that bernd cousin bernhard bu ddy elias played the part of the innkeeper in minna von barnhelm he has artistic leanings says mother thursday july 6 1944 dearest kitty my blood runs cold when peter talks about becoming a criminal or a speculator of course hes joking but i still have the feeling hes afraid of his own weakness margot and peter are always saying to me if i had your spunk a nd your strength if i had your drive and unflagging energy could is it really such an admirable trait not to let myself be influ enced by others am i right in following my own conscience to be honest i cant imagine how anyone could say im weak a nd then stay that way if you know that about yourself why not fight it why not develop your character their answer has always been because its much easier not to this reply leaves me feeling rather discouraged easy does that mean a life of deceit and laziness is easy too oh no that cant be true it cant be tru e that people are so readily tempted by ease and money ive given a lot of thou ght to what my answer should be to how i should get peter to believe in himself and most of all to change himself for the better i dont know whether im on the right t rack ive often imagined how nice it would be if someone were to con fide everything to me but now that its reached that point i realize how diffic ult it is to put yourself in someope elses shoes and find the right answer especially s ince easy and money are new and com pletely alien concepts to me peters beginning to lean on me and i dont want that not unde r any circumstances its hard enough standing on your own two feet but when you al so have to remain true to your character and soul its harder still ive been drifting around at sea have spent days searching f or an effective antidote to that terrible word easy how can i make it clear to him that while it may seem easy and wonderful it will drag him down to the depths to a pl ace where hell no longer find friends support or beauty so far down that he ma y never rise to the surface again were all alive but we dont know why or what for were all se arching for happiness were all leading lives that are different and yet the same w e three have been raised in good famthes we have the opportunity to get an education a nd make something of ourselves we have many reasons to hope for great happiness but we have to earn it and thats something you cant achieve by taking the easy way out earning happiness means doing good and working not speculating and being lazy laziness may look inviting but only work gives you true satisfaction i cant understand people who dont like to work but that isn t peters problem either he just doesnt have a goal plus he thinks hes too stupid and inferior to ever achieve anything poor boy hes never known how it feels to make some one else happy and im afraid i cant teach him he isnt religious scoffs at je sus christ and takes the lords name in vain and though im not orthodox either it hu rts me every time to see him so lonely so scornful so wretched people who are religious should be glad since not everyone i s blessed with the ability to believe in a higher order you dont even have to live in fea r of eternal punishment the concepts of purgatory heaven and hell are difficult for many people to accept yet religion itself any religion keeps a person on the right pa th not the fear of god but upholding your own sense of honor and obeying your own consci ence how noble and good everyone could be if at the end of each day they were to r eview their own behavior and weigh up the rights and wrongs they would autom atically try to do better at the start of each new day and after a while would ce rtainly accomplish a great deal everyone is welcome to this prescription it cos ts nothing and is definitely useful those who dont know will have to find out by experien ce that a quiet conscience gives you strength yours anne m frank saturday july 8 1944 dearest kitty mr broks was in beverwijk and managed to get hold of strawber ries at the produce auction they arrived here dusty and full of sand but in larg e quantities no less than twentyfour crates for the office and us that very same even ing we canned the first six jars and made eight jars of jam the next morning miep star ted making jam for the office at twelvethirty the outside door was locked crates were lu gged into the kitchen with peter father and mr van daan stumbling up the stairs a nne got hot water from the water heater margotwent for a bucket all hands on de ck with a funny feeling in my stomach i entered the overcrowded office kitchen mie p bep mr kleiman jan father peter the annex contingent and the supply corps all mixed up together and that in the middle of the day curtains and windows open loud voices banging doors i was trembling with excitement i kept thinking are we r eally in hiding this must be how it feels when you can finally go out into the world a gain the pan was full so i dashed upstairs where the rest of the family was hu lling strawberries around the kitchen table at least thats what they were supposed to be doing but more was going into their mouths than into the buckets they were boun d to need another bucket soon peter went back downstairs but then the doorbe ll rang twice leaving the bucket where it was peter raced upstairs and shut the bookca se behind him we sat kicking our heels impatiently the strawberries were waiti ng to be rinsed but we stuck to the house rule no running water when strangers are downs tairs they might hear the drains jan came up at one to tell us it had been the mail man peter hur ried downstairs again dingdong the doorbell aboutface i listened t o hear if anyone was coming standing first at the bookcase then at the top of the stairs finally peter and i leaned over the banister straining our ears like a couple o f burglars to hear the sounds from downstairs no unfamthar voices peter tip toe d halfway down the stairs and called out bep once more bep his voice was drowned out by the racket in th e kitchen so he ran down to the kitchen while i nervously kept watch from above go upstairs at once peter the accountants here youve got to leave it was mr kuglers voice sighing peter came upstairs and closed the bookcase mr kugler finally came up at onethirty my gosh the whole worlds turned to strawberries i had strawber ries for breakfast jans hav ing diem for lunch kleimans eating them as a snack mieps bothng them beps h ulling them and i can smell them everywhere i go i come upstairs to get away from al l that red and what do i see people washing strawberries the rest of the strawberries were canned that evening two j ars came unsealed father quickly turned them into jam the next morning two mo re lids popped up and that afternoon four lids mr van daan hadnt gotten the jar s hot enough when he was sterthzing them so father ended up making jam every evening we ate hot cereal with strawberries buttermilk with strawberries bread with st rawberries strawberries for dessert straw berries with sugar strawberries with sand for two days there was nothing but strawberries strawberries strawberries an d then our supply was either exhausted or in jars safely under lock and key hey anne margot called out one day mrs van hoeven has l et us have some peas twenty pounds thats nice of her i replied and it certainly was but it s so much work ugh on saturday youve aji got to shell peas mother announce d at the table and sure enough this morning after breakfast our biggest en amel pan appeared on the table filled to the brim with peas if you think shelling pea s is boring work you ought to try removing the inner linings i dont think many people r ealize that once youve pulled out the linings the pods are soft delicious and rich in vitamins but an even greater advantage is that you get nearly three times as much a s when you eat just the peas stripping pods is a precise and meticulous job that might be s uited to pedantic dentists or finicky spice experts but its a horror for an impatient t eenager like me we started work at ninethirty i sat down at tenthirty got up again at eleven sat down again at eleventhirty my ears were humming with the fo llowing refrain snap the end strip the pod pull the string pod in the pan snap th e end strip the pod pull the string pod in the pan etc etc my eyes were swimming g reen green worm string rotten pod green green to fight the boredom and ha ve something to do i chattered all morn ing saying whatever came into my head an d making everyone laugh the monotony was killing me every string i pulled mad e me more certain that i never ever want to be just a housewife at twelve we finally ate breakfast but from twelvethirty t o onefifteen we had to strip pods again when i stopped i felt a bit seasick and so d id the others i napped until four still in a daze because of those wretched peas yours anne m frank saturday july 151944 dearest kitty weve received a book from the library with the challenging t itle what do you think of the modern young girl id like to discuss this subject tod ay the writer criticizes todays youth from head to toe thou gh without dismissing them all as hopeless cases on the contrary she believes they h ave it within their power to build a bigger better and more beautiful world but that t hey occupy themselves with superficial things without giving a thought to true be auty in some passages i had the strong feeling that the writer was directing her disa pproval at me which is why i finally want to bare my soul to you and defend myself agai nst this attack i have one outstanding character trait that must be obvious t o anyone whos known me for any length of time i have a great deal of selfknowledge in everything i do i can watch myself as if i were a stranger i can stand c across fr om the everyday anne and without being biased or making excuses watch what shes doing both the good and the bad this selfawareness never leaves me and ev ery time i open my mouth i think you should have said that differently or t hats fine the way it is i condemn myself in so many ways that im beginning to realize t he truth of fathers adage every child has to raise itself parents can only ad vise their children or point them in the right direction ultimately people shape their own characters in addition i face life with an extraordinary amount of courage i feel so strong and capable of bearing burdens so young and free when i first realized thi s i was glad because it means i can more easily withstand the blows life has in store but ive talked about these things so often now id like to tu rn to the chapter father and mother dont understand me my parents have always spoi led me rotten treated me kindly defended me against the van daans and done all that parents can and yet for the longest time ive felt extremely lonely left out ne glected and misunderstood father did everything he could to curb my rebellious spirit but it was no use ive cured myself by holding my behavior up to the light and lookin g at what i was doing wrong why didnt father support me in my struggle why did he fall sh ort when he tried to offer me a helping hand the answer is he used the wrong metho ds he always talked to me as if i were a child going through a difficult phas e it sounds crazy since fathers the only one whos given me a sense of confiden ce and made me feel as if im a sensible person but he overlooked one thing he fa iled to see that this struggle to triumph over my difficulties was more important to me than anything else i didnt want to hear about typical adolescent problems o r other girls or youll grow out of it i didnt want to be treated the same as allthe othergirls but as anneinherownright and rim didnt understand that be sides i cant confide in anyone unless they tell me a lot about themselves and becaus e i know very little about him i cant get on a more intimate footing rim always a cts like the elderly father who once had the same fleeting im pulses but who can n o longer relate to me as a friend no matter how hard he tries as a result ive ne ver shared my outlook on life or my longpondered theories with anyone but my diary and once in a while margot ive hid any thing having to do with me from fa ther never shared my ideals with him deliberately alienated myself from him i couldnt have done it any other way ive let myself be guide d entirely by my feelings it was egotistical but ive done what was best for my own peace of mind i would lose that plus the selfconfidence ive worked so har d to achieve if i were to be subjected to criticism halfway through the job it may sou nd hardhearted but i cant take criticism from rim either because not only do i ne ver share my innermost thoughts with him but ive pushed him even further away by be ing irritable this is a point i think about quite often why is it that rim ann oys me so much sometimes i can hardly bear to have him tutor me and his affe ction seems forced i want to be left alone and id rather he ignored me for a while u ntil im more sure of myself when im talking to him im still torn with guilt abou t the mean letter i wrote him when i was so upset oh its hard to be strong and brave in e very way still this hasnt been my greatest disappointment no i th ink about peter much more than i do father i know very well that he was my conquest and n ot the other way around i created an image of him in my mind pictured him as a q uiet sweet sensitive boy badly in need of friendship and love i needed t o pour out my heart to a living person i wanted a friend who would help me find my way a gain i accomplished what i set out to do and drew him slowly but surely toward me when i finally got him to be my friend it automatically developed into an intim acy that when i think about it now seems outrageous we talked about the most priv ate things but we havent yet touched upon the things closest to my heart i sti ll cant make head or tail of peter is he superficial or is it shyness that holds him ba ck even with me but putting all that aside i made one mistake i used intimacy to get closer to him and in doing so i ruled out other forms of friendship he longs to be loved and i can see hes beginning to like me more with each passing day our time together leaves him feeling satisfied but just makes me want to start all over ag ain i never broach the subjects i long to bring out into the open i forced peter mor e than he realizes to get close to me and now hes holding on for dear life i honest ly dont see any effective way of shaking him off and getting him back on his ow n two feet i soon realized he could never be a kindred spirit but still tried t o help him break out of his narrow world and expand his youthful horizons deep down the young are lonelier than the old i read this i n a book somewhere and its stuck in my mind as far as i can tell its true so if youre wondering whether its harder for the adults her e than for the children the answer is no its certainly not older people have an opi nion about everything and are sure of themselves and their actions its twice as hard f or us young people to hold on to our opinions at a time when ideals are being shatter ed and destroyed when the worst side of human nature predominates when everyone h as come to doubt truth justice and god anyone who claims that the older folks have a more difficult t ime in the annex doesnt realize that the problems have a far greater impact o n us were much too young to deal with these problems but they keep thrusting th emselves on us until finally were forced to think up a solution though most of t he time our solutions crumble when faced with the facts its difficult in times li ke these ideals dreams and cherished hopes rise within us only to be crushed by grim rea lity its a wonder i havent abandoned all my ideals they seem so absurd and impr actical yet i cling to them because i still believe in spite of everything that pe ople are truly good at heart its utterly impossible for me to build my life on a foundatio n of chaos suffering and death i see the world being slowly transformed into a wilder ness i hear the approaching thunder that one day will destroy us too i fee l the suffering of millions and yet when i look up at the sky i somehow feel that everythi ng will change for the better that this cruelty too shall end that peace and tr anquthty will return once more in the meantime i must hold on to my ideals perhaps the day will come when ill be able to realize them yours anne m frank friday july 21 1944 dearest kitty im finally getting optimistic now at last things are goi ng well they really are great news an assassination attempt has been made on hitler s life and for once not by jewish communists or english capitalists but by a german general whos not only a count but young as well the fuhrer owes his life to divine providence he escaped unfortunately with only a few minor burns and scra tches a number of the officers and generals who were nearby were killed or wounded the head of the conspiracy has been shot this is the best proof weve had so far that many officers and g enerals are fed up with the war and would like to see hitler sink into a bottomles s pit so they can establish a mthtary dictatorship make peace with the allie s rearm themselves and after a few decades start a new war perhaps providence is de liberately biding its time getting rid of hider since its much easier and cheape r for the allies to let the impeccable germans kill each other off its less work for th e russians and the british and it allows them to start rebuilding their own cities all th at much sooner but we havent reached that point yet and id hate to anticipate th e glorious event still youve probably noticed that im telling the truth the whol e truth and nothing but the truth for once im not rattling on about high ideals furthermore hitler has been so kind as to announce to his loy al devoted people that as of today all mthtary personnel are under orders of the gest apo and that any soldier who knows that one of his superiors was involved in th is cowardly attempt on the fuhrers life may shoot him on sight a fine kettle of fish that will be little johnnys feet are so re after a long march and his commanding officer bawls him out johnny grabs his rifle shouts you you tried to kill the fuhrer take that one shot and the snooty offic er who dared to reprimand him passes into eternal life or is it eternal deat h eventually every time an officer sees a soldier or gives an order hell be practica lly wetting his pants because the soldiers have more sayso than he does were you able to follow that or have i been skipping from one s ubject to another again i cant help it the prospect of going back to school in october is making me too happy to be logical oh dear didnt i just get through tel ling you i didnt want to anticipate events forgive me kitty they dont call me a bu ndle of contradictions for nothing yours anne m frank tuesday august 1 1944 dearest kitty a bundle of contradictions was the end of my previous lette r and is the beginning of this one can you please tell me exactly what a bundle of cont radictions is what does contradiction mean like so many words it can be inte rpreted in two ways a contradiction imposed from without and one imposed from wit hin the former means not accepting other peoples opinions always knowing best having the last word in short all those unpleasant traits for which im known the l atter for which im not known is my own secret as ive told you many times im split in two one side contain s my exuberant cheerfulness my flippancy my joy in life and above all my abthty to appreciate the lighter side of things by that i mean not finding anything wr ong with flirtations a kiss an embrace an offcolor joke this side of me is usuall y lying in wait to ambush the other one which is much purer deeper and finer n o one knows annes better side and thats why most people cant stand me oh i c an be an amusing clown for an afternoon but after that everyones had enough of me t o last a month actually im what a romantic movie is to a profound thinker a mere div ersion a comic interlude something that is soon forgotten not bad but no t particularly good either i hate having to tell you this but why shouldnt i admit it when i know its true my lighter more superficial side will always steal a march on t he deeper side and therefore always win you cant imagine how often ive tried to push away this anne which is only half of what is known as anneto beat her down hi de her but it doesnt work and i know why im afraid that people who know me as i usually am will discove r i have another side a better and finer side im afraid theyll mock me think im ridiculous and sentimental and not take me seriously im used to not being taken serious ly but only the lighthearted anne is used to it and can put up with it the d eeper anne is too weak if i force the good anne into the spotlight for even fift een minutes she shuts up like a clam the moment shes called upon to speak and lets a nne number one do the talking before i realize it shes disappeared so the nice anne is never seen in company shes never made a si ngle appearance though she almost always takes the stage when im alone i kno w exactly how id like to be how i am on the inside but unfortunately im only li ke that with myself and perhaps thats whyno im sure thats the reason why i think of myself as happy on the inside and other people think im happy on the out side im guided by the pure anne within but on the outside im nothing but a frol icsome little goat tugging at its tether as ive told you what i say is not what i feel which is why i hav e a reputation for being boycrazy as well as a flirt a smart aleck and a reader o f romances the happygolucky anne laughs gives a flippant reply shrugs her shoulders and pretends she doesnt give a darn the quiet anne reacts in jus t the opposite way if im being completely honest ill have to admit that it does m atter to me that im trying very hard to change myself but that i im always up aga inst a more powerful enemy a voice within me is sobbing you see thats whats become o f you youre surrounded by negative opinions dismayed looks and mockin g faces people who dislike you and all because you dont listen to the advice o f your own better half believe me id like to listen but it doesnt work becaus e if im quiet and serious everyone thinks im putting on a new act and i have to save myse lf with a joke and then im not even talking about my own family who assume i mus t be sick stuff me with aspirins and sedatives feel my neck and forehead to see if i have a temperature ask about my bowel movements and berate me for being in a bad mo od until i just cant keep it up anymore because jj when everybody starts ho vering over me i get cross then sad and finally end up turning my heart inside g o ut the bad part on the outside and the good part on the inside and keep trying to fin d a way to become what id like to be and what i could be if if only there were n o other people in the world yours anne m frank annes diary ends here afterword on the morning of august 4
